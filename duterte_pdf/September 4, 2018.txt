Well I would like to thank Israel, the government and the people for inviting us here to see for ourselves in
visuals what we have read time and again in our history books.
We know the brutal and cruel journey of the Israelites. From one scattered generation finally finding their
place under the sun. We are happy that — witnesses to this event.
And I said my daughter is... I wouldn’t say that now. But she is a descendant of a Jew in the Philippines,
probably came there to seek the sanctuary. There was a time when we welcomed Jews in the Philippines to
provide them a country of refuge. I cannot speak for my daughter how she feels now but she is one of those
generations that came after.
Me, I realized that war is insanity. And what happened here, in Europe especially under the Nazi.
I could not imagine of a country obey an insane leader. And I could not ever fathom the spectacle of a human
being going into a killing spree, murdering old men, women, men, children, mother.
I hope that this will not happen again. But we are a world whose — now... We have learned so much along
the years during the two wars. There is always a lesson to be learned and that despots and leaders who
show insanity should be — well they should be disposed of at the first instance.
I would like to say that we are one in saying that it will not happen again and my country will be the first to
voice such I said a massacre of a race just because of hate.
Never again.  
May the world learn the lessons of this horrific and benighted period of human history.  
May the hearts of peoples around the world remain ever open.
And may the minds of all men and women learn to work together towards providing a safe haven for all who
are being persecuted.
