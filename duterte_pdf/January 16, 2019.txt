PRESIDENT DUTERTE: Thank you. Welcome, Your Excellency.
We are honored to have the very first Sri Lankan President --- serving as a
Head of State and Government --- visit the Philippines.
In the last few years, our bilateral engagement has significantly broadened.
There, however, remains much room for growth.
Today let us provide the much-needed impetus and direction to significantly
expand and deepen cooperation between our two countries.
Your opening statement, Your Excellency.
