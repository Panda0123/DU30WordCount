Your Excellency, I was informed that you’re already here. Pardon for about
two minutes late. I was just signing some papers.
But I am very happy of your presence today and congratulations to your
new deployment. I understand this is the first ambassadorial assignment
that you have for the Republic of Thailand.
I’m sure that you would learn so many things along the way. You won’t have
a hard time. We are similar in all things including our desire to have a
peaceful southeast Pacific region. Welcome.
I accept your lettre de créance and just a few minutes may I invite you to a
room so we can have a little tête-à-tête and before that I’d like to have a
picture with you. I’d learned that a very handsome guy from Thailand visited
my country.
I accept your assignment. Can we have a picture taking?
