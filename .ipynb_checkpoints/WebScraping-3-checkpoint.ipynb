      "two urgent matters that i will bring to the attention of the people of the philippines. one is the lackadaisical attitude of some big business to do away with contractualization. alam mo, i heard secretary bello of the department of labor saying that he’ll be fielding more warm bodies, more men to do the inspection because medyo may mga kumpanya pa, pati korporasyon o whatever would fall under the category of one who has to do away with contractualization. alam mo, wala akong pera, wala akong tao to really inspect all of the in the category of you know, doing away with the contractualization. my message to them is very simple. do not wait for us to inspect. i would like to assume that everybody who falls under that category will honor what we are asking for the people. huwag na ninyo akong hintayin na mahuli ko kayo because i will be unforgiving. you will not only lose your money, you will lose your funds. i will no tolerance ako dito. ito ang pangako ko sa tao and i will do it. hintuan na ninyo yan, bayaran ninyo ang tao sa tamang suweldo. stop contractualization! it will not do good to our country. huwag ninyo akong huwag na ninyong mahuli kayo ni secretary bello. pag nalaman ko, i’ll just simply close your plant and would always find a thousand reason to do it. believe me. don’t tempt the you know eh nakakaawa yung tao, you are creating a very serious dissension in the society. some are despondents, they are being passed to one expertise to another. sabi ko, yung tesda, we spend so much training people for a particular skill and kung yang contractualization na yan, he gets one position today, for the next five months, sabi ko nga, electricians, when all the while, he was trained to be a plumber or a carpenter. you do not help the people with the security of tenure. at itong mga nagsu supply ng manpower, agencies pati mga security mga security guards. alam mo, ito sila, they work 24 hours ang shift nila. when they’re only supposed to render 8 hours. alam mo, karamihan yang may ari ng security agencies, most of them are military men. i’d like to tell you now, magsunod kayo o ikakanselar ko yang permit ninyo. mamili kayo. mga security guard 24 hours, kaya natutulog. kaya ka hindi nakadeliver ng services doon, may outsource yung manpower, eh beinte kuwatro patrabahuhin mo yung tao? alam mo, kayo tala tayong pilipino, medyo matigas talaga ulo natin. you know, brasuhin ko kayong lahat. eh masama yan eh, sa bayan. stop it! ako ba naman, kung ikakaligaya ng lahat yan, and it would improve, enhance our economy, wala kayong problema sa akin. but a human being, lalo na yung security guard. pay all the benefits. yung mga nag outsource, ikaw yung ahensya, the agency you take over as the employer. then pay, lahat kayo, huwag kayong yumaman diyan ng pawis ng kapwa ninyo tao. kalokohan yan. if you are nag outsource, whatever, airlines, assume therefore as the real employer. so bayaran ninyo lahat: sss. tsaka wala yang paikut ikot, huwag ninyong paikutin kasi ang totoo niyan, ayaw talaga niyo magbayad ng mean, if you do not take care of the workers, then i cannot take care of you. eh ano yan eh, quid pro quo, quid pro quo; tit for tat. so, yan ang warning ko. second is mining. huwag ninyong anuhin ang si gina lopez by publicity. hindi siya marunong asan si gina? she is not an incompetent she’s a bright lady and she is simply a crusader. kayong mga minahan diyan, pati yang marcopper, hanggang ngayon, hindi pa ninyo nalinis yung dumi ninyo. i will not allow it. you only give me 40 billion, lahat kayo each year, i can do away with the 14, sirahan ko kayo lahat. you obey or we will survive as a nation without you. huwag ninyo akong anuhan na, you you try to castigate gina lopez for being strict and yet you destroy the land, destroy the soil tapos yung yayaman kayo diyan. yung iba, mga oligarchs, papartner partner na kayo, kung sinu sinong partner niyo mga foreigners and you get rich at the expense of our native land. do not do it. i will not allow it. forty billion? i can forego with the 40 billion i collect from you guys. and the filipinos will survive without you. either you follow strictly government standards or you close up. lahat ng butasan ng dito na, walang lisensya. i will order the military and the police to close them. pag ayaw ninyong sumunod, ipapasok niyo doon sa butas, takpan ko kayo kasali. you want to try it? fine. let’s do it. eh butas ka ng butas diyan, landslide ng landslide. tapos sabihin ninyo, mining is a critical component on the philippine economy. of course, it is. its income, but you are also making a critical damage. hindi lang man ito nasabi ninyo na ewan ko kung nag basta anybody violating the minimum wage law, di kayo nagbabayad ng tama. you go ahead with the contractualization, i will close you. huwag ka nang maghintay ng business permit, i’ll always find a thousand and one reason to close you. eh gusto ninyo, brasuhin kayo eh. nakikiusap na nga yung gobyerno na para makatulong sa kapwa tao niya. or if i cannot do it, magpunta na ako, magresign ako. maghanap kayo ng ibang presidente. of course, si robredo yan. fine. pero pag sumunod kayo, sabi ko sa inyo, maawa naman kayo sa kapwa tao ninyo. mga gobyerno losing. kailan pa ba kayo nalugi? yumayaman ka ng yumaman, araw araw. yes, hindi ito klase, ba’t ka mag raise ng hands? ah, yeah, okay. * * *  ",
      " \n",
      " hinuhuli mo talaga ako. gusto mo akong yariin ng komunista ano? well, anyway, as a president, i cannot you know, go into an exercise of a polter ideological poltergeist. i can only poltergeist i can only go along, coast along and get the advice of the people whom i have tasked. i cannot run my own errands. i have to do serious work here. i cannot also go there and talk to them. so kung anong ibigay sa akin yan, advice nila with the talks, i will think about it, sleep on it perhaps, then i will make a decision. at this time, dureza i have yet to talk to dureza and bello, so i cannot answer you properly. but when the time comes, you will have all the facts that you want. but at this time, i said kind of a but i will not go into a foul mouth thing here because i am talking for the republic, in behalf of the republic. \n",
      " wala kaming misunderstanding. sinabi ko, there is a lot sila yang nag uusap, hindi ako. bakit ako ang mag misunderstand sa kanila? i have not talked to them. \n",
      " i am not the protagonist there. \n",
      " a what? ",
      " \n",
      " naniwala ka pala sa kanila. sino ba ang pinaniniwalaan mo? sila o ako? \n",
      " yeah, i said, let me be very i’ll give you a visual, for all this fighting: 43, 40 years, 45 years they never even had a control of one barangay for a day. me? i was elected by about 16 million of our countrymen for whom i’m really thankful. sila? they could not even get to elect a leftist. talo palagi. tapos sila ang paniwalaan mo. maniwala ka pala. \n",
      " look, i got a six million margin. anong margin na pag ? they hardly could you know, get people of their kind to be elected. sa davao, ako pa ang magdala bayan and only because i share some of their visions about how a country should help its citizens and to run government. celerina monte : sir, celerina monte from manila shimbun. sir, regarding your warnings with these yung companies, businessmen. are we seeing any possible closure of any companies president \n",
      " yes. \n",
      " if you are asking, yes. \n",
      " you point out to me one violating now and i’ll close it. \n",
      " you get to answer, you know, you get the obligation to \n",
      " well, i’m sorry. whether it’s really sm or lahat. i can even close the entire republic of the philippines and we can all go into hunger strike. \n",
      " lahat tayo. sabayan ko, ako mauna. \n",
      " i guess the commission, we will be talking about it just good as any other time to do it but it’s scheduled to be taken up by the cabinet this afternoon. \n",
      " it will be a long night for us. \n",
      " hindi ko papatulan iyan eh. i am not an ideological poltergeist. i am the president talking properly to you to have peace in this land. bakit man ako hindi naman ako insecure. eh syempre, i got 16 million, a margin of 16 million plus. eh sila, hindi nga sila makahawak ng isang barangay, wala naman silang hardly. but the leftist guys before were elected because of their intellectual competence, not because they belong to the left. rocky ignacio : president \n",
      " o, kumusta ka? akala ko ba dito ka nagtrabaho? hindi kita nakikita. \n",
      " well, you know rocky, i’ve been trying to i was looking around because i want to make several occasions, a statement. wala naman akong mahanap na \n",
      " sabihin mo kaibigan tayo, maniwala ka naman sa mga psg. \n",
      " sabihin mo sa psg na, \n",
      " i really i pray to god na it will gusto ko sa generation ko, with the mi, mn, huwag lang yung mga criminal. wala kasi akong i cannot see, rocky, a redeeming factor to open my mouth and begin to talk about peace with criminals. kasi hindi man hihinto yan. criminality is a to crave for money, to reach into your hands the dirty way. i cannot do that. \n",
      " kaya nga ako nag declare ng ceasefire eh. \n",
      " ako pa ang namatayan, kami pa ngayon ang kontrabida. i declared a truce, nagbabaan yung mga sundalo galing bukid, tapos inambush. kami na nga ang namatayan, si yung kaibigan ko pa ang tumatalsik yung tumatalsik yung laway ko, gusto ko magpayong, lumalabas sa television eh. \n",
      " look, i cannot stop talking about peace. i am a president who is supposed to bring peace to his land. whether it’s really sison or not, whether i’d like to talk to sison or not, it’s not important, it’s not relevant at all. the issue is, the left, not only sison, but that would include sison, the left, the entire leftist community or bloc dito sa atin. we cannot agree on all of these things. merong right, left, center. me, at this time, rocky, i just believe that i have to look for that peace for my land during my generation. if i fail, mahirap na, including mindanao. reymund tinaza : sir, good afternoon. reymund tinaza ng bombo radyo. sir, you’ve mentioned previously during your speeches na . but now, with this not so acceptable respond of your good faith from the ndf npa, are you still willing for another extra mile walk just for peace? president \n",
      " yes. i dare them. challenge ko sa kanila: let us not only talk, mag marathon tayo. \n",
      " good. thank you for the question. if i and the others would insist, that was my first position. iyon yung akin original. wala pa akong naging hindi pa ako naging presidente. because i thought that a constitutional convention would be more in keeping with the a constitutional promise that the people would really believe in, would trust. wala silang walang there’s nothing at the back of their minds. ganito yan, nung nag usap na kami sa national security council, we decided to push for constitutional changes pero constituent assembly. ang sabi ni diokno, kasama namin, it would take us billions. wala na akong pera eh. i came midstream. i have so many things to do. i have to maintain yung 4ps. i am now, i would like to announce to you that i am taking in more, about 10,000 soldiers and 5,000 policemen to safeguard the integrity of the country. nothing to do with the communists, nothing to do with the mi, mn. it’s simply making a strong, given also the external threats that we are now facing. i’m not particularly attributing it to any country. so, that is the having said that, masyadong malaki. now, if it’s a matter of just i sense a feeling of contempt diyan sa con ass maybe because it’s really not a good thing also to abbreviate yung because it’s give us a pain in the ass, you know, sometimes. masyadong magasto and alam mo, yung nagdadaldal diyan na ah, hindi na,’ these are the guys who cannot be elected anyhow. and there are these guys na they think they are the only principled and honest persons in this universe. why would you now begin to doubt the sincerity of a filipino? o, kung meron mang isa, dalawang magnanakaw diyan, tatlo, apat, you cannot make a sweeping statement na people do not trust these guys to make a good constitution, to craft a new one that would serve this generation because yung iba nga diyan had been elected time and again, dalawang dekada na, tatlong dekada, pati itong kaharap mo. i’ve been all in all 40 years of politics. who are you to tell me na in the end, honest, kayo lang? god! so yung mga senador diyan, repeatedly elected, eh di in all probability, they are good because they have been elected time and again. at saka nandiyan ako, ang executive department. andiyan defense, andiyan yung tourism, whatever you place them, will be reviewed by the cabinet and if there is anything there that’s really despicable to the filipino, i’d simply tell you: do not do that. ako mismo dito and you mangle a constitution, you come up, you craft a bullshit constitution, bakit, would i allow it? would the military would allow it? the police? the civilian? the mayors? nandiyan rin ako. so meron na tayong ibang constitution, same wording, same lahat, due process, human rights. automatic yan sila, maybe just a thing or two about the economic prosperity of this nation. so therefore, you need to reconfigure the distribution sa shares, how many shares would you concede to the andand about the land ownership. it’s time to revisit the constitution. it’s time to rethink how we look at things from afar and bring a constitution that would serve the filipino at this time of his life. itong generation natin eh kita mo hirap ka dyan, luhod ka nang luhod eh, bakit ka kasi nakasimangot diyan? kaya ganun eh, so i’m trying to bring i do not promise heaven or pure happiness to the filipino. but i can promise you perhaps, if i succeed, a comfortable life for all.   president \n",
      " yan lang ang akin, wala na akong wala ng drama. iyon lang. o isa, e di dalawa, okay yan. \n",
      " abu sayyaf has no redeeming factor. it does not have an ideology unlike the communists and maybe the mi, mn, that they are fighting and revolting against government, the duly constituted authorities, because they’d want to change or supplant one that they think would be good for the entire community. kaya sabi ng mga komunista, bulok yan,’ kayong mga kapitalista,’ lalo na, well of course, and i must admit that you are correct, communist, yung graft and corruption. talagang it has pulled our country down, not only in terms of prosperity but yung talagang productivity. kasi ayaw ng iba, kasi hingi dito, hingi doon. first day pa lang paglagay diyan sa table na yan, umpisa na ang karate. that will not happen during my watch. i will never allow it. makalusot ka man pero bigyan talaga kita. \n",
      " standing order is to ano bang trabaho nila? to protect the integrity of the nation. and, of course, to fight the enemies of the state who would want to challenge us, to bring us down, to pull us down, the duly constituted authorities. there was an election, every congressman, mayor, councilor, president were elected in a very orderly way. so by the essence of democracy, ang leader or leaders of the country is chosen by the people. it cannot be an imposed leadership. \n",
      " yes \n",
      " diretso na. i think i’m ready with 8888 and 911. just kaya sabi ko, my warning is not to i’m not trying to scare you. but itong warning ko sa gobyerno: pag sinabi ng gobyerno: yan. yan na yan. huwag mo nang hintayin magkasala ka. you just obey para walang gulo. kaya yan pagka sinarhan kita, huwag kang magpunta sa akin dito at you mainsulto pa kita. mainsulto ako, gagawa ka nang masama, pupunta ka sa akin, insultuhin mo ako ng mga tear jerking stories about wala ng kapital, pakialam ko. sinabi ko sa inyo, sumunod kayo. now, it would mean a reduction of your corporate profits, fine. share it with the people. tutal, matagal naman itong contractualization. if you think that you’d lose, then close shop. isarahan mo at magfarming ka na lang. i need a lot of farming endeavors back there in mindanao. tinotoo rin talaga ninyo hanggang alas diyes tayo no? diyan ako bilib sa inyo eh. so we have about five more hours to go . sige, sige, sige. sa totoo lang. i’m just joking actually. you guys can take your time. \n",
      " hindi lang yan, the other is gutierrez, yung sa dubai. iyong nagpapasok ng eroplano dito na walang bayad bayad. they are the oligarchs of the modern kind. iyan, yan sila. you sell your country to the dogs. kaya ako galit, one of the reasons why i ran is because government itself was not hindi ngayon, hindi was oppressing the people. kaya rin one of the compelling reasons na nag udyok sa akin kasi yan nga. you’re throwing your country to the dogs. why would you allow black sand mining? whatever is really the purpose to this generation, leave it there. our children will better well, we better in a position to determine how they would use it in the future. yes? nandiyan si gina. sabi ko, si gina lopez has my full support. so stop this nonsense of discrediting her because i won’t believe you a bit. yes? \n",
      " no, no, no. i have to fix the malacan maguindanao, ah, no! mindanao issue. tignan ko yung framework, i’m set to i have to travel to cotabato to talk again to hurry up. and i travel to jolo to talk to nur. sabi ko sa mga military pati pulis, you might want to consider just for a day makalabas lang sila. paalamin kita, alam ko gusto kang sumama eh. \n",
      " okay ka diyan. \n",
      " i’m talking to sison, he’s a fugitive. and the fact na he violated the ano tapos sumibat, so hindi na umuwi. nur misuari also, they are waging rebellions, okay. it is ideology driven. so ang redeeming factor diyan is you rebel because you want a better setup or better life for the people. kaya nga ang punishment ng rebellion, mababa. walang death penalty, i think it’s prision correccional to prision mayor. it’s about the longest is 12 years and if yung mag ano ka pa, but all of these guys will have my i’ll consider an amnesty kung magkausap tayo at we can agree to a peaceful co existence. i will accommodate them. \n",
      " no, on that day, wala siguro, i’ll just give them a safe conduct pass because pag hindi ko nakausap, how do we fix these things? you have a better way of doing it? tell me. paano ako hindi ko makausap si so what good would it do, sinong puntahan ko nung abu sayyaf? \n",
      " sabihin mo kay judiciary, pssst sabi ni mayor duterte’ huwag kang maingay. \n",
      " no, i just have about a day or two. kausapin ko lang sabihin ko, nur, once the talk starts, i’ll give everybody a safe conduct pass.’ alam mo, i’d like to make it public, not to flatter misuari or anybody. you take in custody kay nur tapos may nangyari yan dito sa custody ng government, ng sundalo o pulis, forget about talking about peace in mindanao. so with the rebels the other side, you take custody. hulihin mo yan sila murad, si jaafar, tapos may nangyari yan while in custody, sabihin ko sa inyo, my advice: sabi ko sa military pati pulis, you will just have to navigate the way as it is been done, and a process of negotiation. everywhere. when you talk to the rebels, you have to give them a safe conduct pass or at least a sense of security to face you and talk about what’s bugging the country. okay? again, ma’am? \n",
      " ako, party list? if i have my way, tapos yan sila. \n",
      " ah, akala ko partylist. partylist, i’m not inclined to recreate them in a new constitution. target date is, i said, i’m going to mindanao maybe day after tomorrow and start to look into the firming up of the framework and if i have the time, i’ll just fly to jolo and to murad again to talk and i’ll just give them the firm commitments. ang sabi ko, ”pag meron kayong, adre, that you are really willing to talk with sincerity, then you can begin talking to the government panel’. nandito lang ako eh, i said i cannot run my own errands, i have to send, somebody has to do it for me. \n",
      " the spouses tiamzon? they will be released. iyong ceasefire ng kaibigan ko. i will see if i will also be happy to reinstall a ceasefire. maybe christmas time . well, in the spirit of the season. \n",
      " nauna na ako, tingnan mo ang nangyari. ako pa ang namatayan diyan, tapos ako pa ang sinisisi ngayon. \n",
      " ako naman mag ambush. eh, inambush nila yung sundalo ko. well, i’ll see, i’ll see. i’m just joking. but alam mo, nakukunsumi na ako sa tong mga to, kaya dinadaan ko na lang sa pabiro biro kasi mag heart attack ako. pag nagka heart attack ako, mamatay ako, bintangan mo itong mga komunista.\n"

    "txt = 'Good afternoon to everybody. Mr. Prime Minister. I am very honored to visit the State of Israel. It was an invitation extended.With that, I hope that this country will continue with its friendly and warm relationship. I’d like to thank the State of Israel for the so many assistance given us. But I’d be good to mention it. But in terms of the Marawi siege, we got help from your country. Thank you for that. And thank you for hosting almost 28,000 Filipinos. They have been very happy working here, taking care of the aging population of yours, citizens. And I have heard that they have been treated as human beings unlike in other places of which I am not at liberty to mention now. But the way that they have been received here was shown last night by their jubilation. And of course everytime I mentioned about the kindness and benevolence of Israel, you could here a thunderclap and I am sure that they were came from the heart. Mr. Prime Minister, I can only thank you so much especially the critical help that you have extended my country in time when we needed it most. The recent trouble in my — the Philippines, the extent of the help that you extended were very critical in winning the war. I could have dragged on were it not for the very substantial and crucial equipments, which I am not also at liberty to say now. But it was a help to preserve the Republic of the Philippines and I thank you for that. I thank the State of Israel and the people. And I hope that these ties of us will continue over the years. And I think I have my daughter here who is a Zimmerman. Actually she is a descendant of the Jews, who went to the Philippines and who settled down there many, many years ago during the time of the Holocaust. We received the Israelis there and their families and I am sure that many of them have spread all throughout the country. And one of them is the family of my daughter. It’s not the daughter but the mother was a homegrown Zimmerman in our place. Thank you and may we continue to be blessed with a strong relationship. I do not think that there will ever be a time when there is an irritation even between our two countries. We share the same passion for peace. We share the same passion for human beings but we also share the same passion of not allowing our country to be destroyed by those who have the corrupt ideology who knows nothing but to kill and destroy. In this sense, Israel can expect any help that the Philippines can extend to your country. Thank you very much.'"
