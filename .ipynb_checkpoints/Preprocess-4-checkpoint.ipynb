Magkaila man ta tanan ‘tong mayor ko. Apan ug naa’y usa ka tao nga akong nahibaw-an nakasabot sa inyo —If there was any other official in this government who really understood the problem sa inyong tanan, kadtong si Mayor Lopez because he was a Bagobo and he was really bright. Extra brilliant na tao.But you know, life is short. Kung nagpabilin siguro siyang buhi karon, basig usa siya sa akong nakuhanga dili lang consultant. Not much is achieved with those consultants, consultants.Hindi talaga pwede ‘yang consultant, consultant, consultant for indigenous. Kayo mismo ang mag-trabaho. Ikaw, Manobo ka. Kayo ‘tong mga ‘to, mga\\xa0[inaudible]\\xa0ba mo o Manobo pud? O Matigsalog?You know, pareho aning Marawi, ganito ang — conceptualize the rehabilitation. I just placed it in one person, si General Del Rosario.I had him recalled. I assigned him a specific assignment. But I believe in him.Tan-awa ang Marawi karon, paspas ang ilang pagbuhat ug balay and we have to also recognize the sweat of Escalada. ‘Yan Escalada.Kugihan ni sa gobyerno. Mu-resign na unta ni niadto because kana gung kwarta-kwarta. Corruption sa — dili siya gustong ma — mu-retire sa gobyerno nga naay mantsa ang iyang pagkatao.But I prevailed upon him to just skate along. Ana ko “Just try your best to — ‘yung mga tao mo, hindi ikaw.” Corruption kasi, ‘yan talaga ang hindi ko matanggap.Kasi mao’y sa akong sabot, ‘pag dagan nako, “No corruption, drugs.” Tatapusin ko talaga ‘yan.Then\\xa0I’ll improve\\xa0the peace and order situation. Then I’ll talk to the rebels on the Muslim insurgency pati itong komunista.Itong mga komunista, kaibigan ko. No doubt about it. For the many times that I’ve been there, niaadto ko sa bukid. Kita man mo nakig-istorya ko.And lahat ‘yan, everytime pinagsu-suspetsahan ako ng military na ano, na sympathizer, leftist. That was the issue against me during the first election. But I won because people of Davao understand.Kinahanglan ko muadto sa bukid kay samok kaayo.Kanang kasamok nato sa komunista, estudyante pa mi. Nag-sige na ko’g paminaw anang Sison kay lagi kung bata ka pa, gusto nimo apurahan.Gusto nimo’g pagbag-o, the ambitions of a youth. ‘Pag gusto nimo — corrupt ang gobyerno, patyon na daan. Diretso na.

Mao na’y imong hustisya ipakita?Kanus-a man ang gobyerno ug sundalo nagputol ug inyong kamot? O giputlan mo’g u***? P**** i**.\\xa0[laughter]Tagai ko’g isa ka butang nga abuso sa gobyerno.

Basi’g wa muabot ang Kristyano diri sa Mindanao, nakahibaw-mo na may Ginoo.Tan-awa ug\\xa0[inaudible]\\xa0— ‘Di man gani mahadlok, maulaw mupatay ug sundalo. Nibalhin lang nga wa siya naka-angay sa ideolohiya aning… Nganong maka-angay ka man pud?Wala’y gobyerong gipakita, singkwenta anyos na.Nagsugod na ta’g ihap karon for another 50 years. And you will — kamong mga Lumad, musugot mo 100 years of exploitation and brutality? Sugot mo ana?[Crowd answers: Hindi!]Ang akong amahan nag-gobernador man.

Pero ug ingnon “daug-daug,” wala mo daug-dauga. Gikalimtan lang mo sa gobyerno pag-lingi. Mao na’y tinuod.But there was never an occasion that you were oppressed or brutalized. Simply because ang mga leader niadto, among amahan, and with the rise of\\xa0Elias\\xa0Lopez for so many years, as mayor of Davao City, ang iyang impluwensiya kusog kaayo.Ug unsa’y isulti niya\\xa0[inaudible]\\xa0he was bright.

Purya — ganahan kong\\xa0[inaudible]\\xa0kay aron mag-istorya ra ta’g tarong.Unsa, pasagdan ta ni sila? Mag-giyera ta? Kinsa ma’y ganahan mupatay ug imong isig ka tao? Ma-solo ba diay na sa Kristyano ang utok?O, si [inaudible], Bagobo man ni. Ngano mang naabot man ni’g lieutenant general? Kay kamo akong gusot himuon mong CAFGU.

Ang problema, wala ninyo gamita.[naa ba ‘tong mapa na distribution sa tribes? Sa briefer. Huwat ra ha.]Mapa sa distribution sa mga Lumads? Mga under sa influence sa NPA?Ani nalang. Ako na mismo. Kanang ancestral home ninyo, tawgon nako ang Agriculture Secretary, si Secretary Piñol.Abaw linte na Ilonggo ni. Sa damo ni nga bright sa Kidapawan. Eh gihimo ko ni siyang Secretary kay farm boy kana. Dako na sa yuta. Unya na-mayor, na-gobernador.Kay gusto niya mga Ilonggo mag-presidente pud. Makadagan ni siya siguro ug presidente kasi ara man sa probinsya.But you know, ako na mismo para walang graft and corruption. I will work… may mga Cabinet members man ako dito. Secretary Dureza is there.\\xa0\\xa0[applause]\\xa0Mamondiong.Ako na’y mamili sa investor. So ‘yung distribution ninyo… Ito dito sa bandang Apo, Talomo Mountain, Manobo, Ata, Matigsalug. Dito sa Anda Valley Complex, Surigao del Sur. Manobo\\xa0[inaudible]\\xa0ug Higaynon.Naa’y ancestral home ninyo. Para wala’y samok, ani man gud na. Ayaw mo’g kasuko.I’m just being brutally frank with you. Tutal ang lola nako Maranao man pud. Pareho man tang tanan.You know, gihatagan mo ani. Ang problema, naa’y enterprising — Ang uban mangita sila’g investor unya mutapok man tanan didto. Muingon, “Amo man pud ni.”Tinuod man na because it is owned in common. Wala’y individual titles ang ancestral home.Pero ug mag sige lang mo’g samok, wala gyu’y mahitabo. So ako’y mamili sa investor.Ang problema, dugay na unta nang Paquibato na dagha’g musulod nga palm oil.Ang objection aning — kamong taga-Paquibato, nahibaw mo. Diba ingon nila makahurot ug tubig? Suyupon ang tubig. Unsaon man diay ang tubig? Pasagdan lang nimo na sa ilalom sa yuta? Ug makatabang nato na?What’s the valid reason for disallowing the planting of\\xa0palm\\xa0oil? Kay\\xa0daghan na’g\\xa0uses including fuel. Gasolina ba para sa mga sakyanan.\\xa0Ang\\xa0fossil fuel, oil na mugawas, that cannot last and it can be controlled. Pero\\xa0ug\\xa0naa ta’y atong bio-fuel… Ang malas man gud sa Pilipinas wala ta’y oil. Gamay ra.Naa pa nang — unsa\\xa0nang y*** nang\\xa0naa\\xa0diha\\xa0sa South China Sea, Malampaya? Gikurakot pa gyud ang kwarta\\xa0diha. Nakinabang na,\\xa0lima ra ka tao.So diyan ako maglagay ng — Kadaghanan sa gobyerno— dili kay ingon nga gusto nako na ma-loyal sila. Dili man na sila loyal nako. Loyal na sila sa kini oh\\xa0[points to Philippine flag]Kitang tanan. Ayaw mog tuo nga ako mag-Presidente for all time. Kay kana silang mga military ug police, dili na sila musugot nga ako mupuyo’g usa ka adlaw sobra sa akong termino.You can be sure that after the end of four years, ug walay mu-replace nga workable, viable Constitution nga federal, ug magpabilin na, I will step down a day ahead. Parang ka\\xa0[inaudible]‘Wa ko mangayo ug suporta nga diktador. ‘Di na sila musugot na mag-diktador ko. Pusilon ko ana mga tawhana.Kana, ga tan-aw ra na sila o. Pero gahuna-huna na sila ug unsaon ko pag-ihaw. Basta mag-diktador ka.Kaya ang Constitution ang\\xa0[inaudible]\\xa0nag-ingon na demokrasya ta. He may be a son of a b****, pero mao na’y pinili sa tao, wala ta’y mahimo. Election. Mao nang sa komunista. They want to enter government at the back door.Sige sila’g istorya nako, pero ang mga gipadala nila, nila [inaudible], wala pa ‘tong kay Dureza ug —By the way, naa si Bebot Bello, mao ning atong Secretary of Labor. Bot. Mudagan pa ni pagka-senador, maayong tao ni. Kauban ko ni sa dormitoryo. Mga pobre lang pud mi.Kami niadtong estudyante, dili mi anak ug dato. Nagpuyo mi ug — Ilokano man ni, Isabela. Ang iyang kauban sa kwarto si Dulay. Ilokano pud taga-Baguio.Ang akong kauban, si\\xa0Yasay, you the one that speaks like…\\xa0[mimics Yasay]\\xa0I don’t understand what he is talking about. But everytime he talks, I would say, “Who is that American beside me who talks like — ?”\\xa0[laughter]Mao to si\\xa0Dureza akong ka-roommate. Si Dureza ana musulti kay anak na ug pastor. Kaya naanad talaga siya. English spokening. So when he talks and the congressman —\\xa0\\xa0[mimics Yasay]\\xa0the Congress beginning to deny him because this man sounds like an American. And he was talking like you know — the Philippines…\\xa0[garbled]Ingnan nako, Gabinete baya nako. Paundanga ra’g sulti nang y*** na. ‘Wa ko kasabot unsa’y gisulti ana.Pagbinisaya. Kay sa Gabinete, mag-Binisaya man ko. So ingnan nako sila, “Di mo kasabot? Ah sige pagtuon mo. Dili ko na problema. Dili ko miyembro, ako’y inyong hepe sa Cabinet. Paminaw mo’g unsa’y akong isulti. ‘Di mo kasabot, pagtuon mo’g Bisaya, kanang Cebuano.”So that’s —\\xa0Gusto sila maki’g-coalesce, coalition government. Gi-ingnan nako sila, “I cannot do that.” Kay ang Constitution nag-ingon — The Constitution is an abstract thing kay puro lang man na suwat. It is represented visually, mao na’y Constitution.Ang nag-ingon ko’g Constitution, nga kinsa ‘tong mugunit sa puder sa gobyerno, kinahanglan pinili sa tao.Mura ma’g irong buang na’g batasan. But if it’s\\xa0the choice of\\xa0\\xa0the people\\xa0[inaudible],\\xa0ana gyud na. So ako —\\xa0\\xa0then ‘tong ilang ceasefire na wala pa gani mahuman, giihaw na nila ‘tong duha ka, tulo ka sundalo.Pangutana nako kaning Eastern Command. “Pila ka sugat ang sundalo?”\\xa0\\xa0Ingon sila, “73.” Mura kamo’g gapatay ug iro. Ka-kontra ba gyud diay tang personal na imong lat-an ang tao ug bala?Didto ko na — So gi tawgan nako\\xa0si General Año, he’s there. Sir, o. Si General Año, mao pa’y chief of staff ngadto.\\xa0DILG na ni siya karon.\\xa0\\xa0Ingnan nako, “Pila?” Ingon siya, “73.” Ingnan nako siya, ana ko, “declare na ko ug — ‘di na ko ug ceasefire. Banat ta.”So ‘di nako makig-istorya nila. It’s\\xa0useless. Kamo, mag-surrender? Pagkahuman, siyempre, CAFGU, CAFGU\\xa0\\xa0lang gud intawon para maswelduhan.Wala man ‘to giingon nga ni-surrender diha sa gobyerno unya gihimong CAFGU para pangaway. Para naa siya’y ma….Unya gipatay, giputlan ug ulo. Malipay ka ana? Ayaw mo pakig-away sa ilaha. Distansiya lang mo. Ug mu-recruit mo, ingna kuwan, Iglesia ko ni Duterte. Unya ang among relihiyong bag-o, Iglesia ni Duterte.Pili ka la’g unsa’y imong gustong Ginoo diha basta pagtinarong nang p**** i** mag sige’g pangaway diha.Ang relihiyon, free. Naay pari diri? Ang chaplain nato basi’g naminaw. Ah, naa’y pari? Hala, kuwan lang ta, Kristyanos lang ta tanan.Mao na’y problema. It’s the violence because they want to join or take over government through the use of arms.Giingnan nako sila ngadto, si Bebot. Left man pud na. Kay anak man na’g pobre. We joined Partido ng Bayan.Pagsulod namo adto’g Manila, nisulod na ning mga hard core. Giingnan nako si Bebot. “Bot, sibat tayo dito.” Gusto mi’g politika. Gusto mi’g partido nga muapil ug election.Dili mi gusto ug partido nga mag-armas para awayon ang election sa patay. ‘Wa gyu’y mahitabo ana. Mahurot nalang intawon ang lumad sa bukid.So ako na’y mangita ug investor. Muingon mo’g dili mo’g mina, eh ‘di dili. Wa’y mina. Ug muingon mo’g gihugaw-hugawan ang inyong lugar, barahon nato.Mao na’y akong commitment karon ninyo. Pero kaning muingon mo diha, kaning diri sa Kitanglad Mountain\\xa0[points to map], Loreto, San Juan, Esperanza. Manobo\\xa0[inaudible]\\xa0ug\\xa0Higaynon.Ug maong na’y maong mina,\\xa0o sige, partner mo. Ang akong proposal kay tanan imong makit-an na, gikan man na sa ilawom sa — everything that you see. Kani puthaw. Kana diha ngadto, gikan na sa ilawom sa…So imposibleng ‘di pud ka mag-mina.\\xa0\\xa0Pero muingon mo’g dili mo, dili nako pugson. So ibawal nako. So mag-istorya ta. Nia man si [inaudible], nia man si Del Rosario.Makig-istorya lang mo sa ila unsa’y gusto ninyo. If you want agriculture alone, mubuhi ko initially. Kana, karong adlawa. Ugma siguro buhian ta mo’g 100 million para sa tabang.[applause]Unya kanang 100 million, hutda ninyo’g inom.\\xa0[laughter]\\xa0P***** i**. Kulatahon ta mo ron. Adtuon ta mo sa bukid. Ibukbok ko nang\\xa0[inaudible]\\xa0sa imong ulo.Malapatan, Alabel, ug Maitum, Sarangani, B’laan. O, unsa ma’y inyong gusto? Agrikultura? Sige. Naa’y —Now I’m making available — di pud diay, di pa diay ko muuli og Manila. Mga — ingna lang si… Pakisabi na lang kay… Alam mo ang kulang, naay nahitabo\\xa0sa Pilipinas na nakakatawa.Ka na magbuhat ng building, ika’y architect, ako ang contractor. Kinahanglan ko’g tawo. Kinahanglan ko’g… kana diha. Dili ko makakuha diri sa gawas. Wala manay nahiba-an ang y***.Kanang mga karpinterong dugay na — kasilyas, di man diay na muhatag nimo’g ordinaryong tao. Ngano — unsa’y kalibutan ana paghagbong sa igit?Master plumber gyud na, master electrician. Nawala ang atong mga trabahante karon. Sige sila pangita. Pareho diri sa Davao, kakita ka’g building didto, building diri ug sa Manila.Karon ingon sila “Mayor, ang ako ba —” Ana ko “Adto-a si Inday, siya ma’y nahibaw.” Ingon si Inday “Wala na ta’y trabahante.”Ang gusto gani ni Inday, undangon na ang improvement kay dako ra kaayo unya di na makaya.Nabigla na eh, pareho sa Manila. Pero ang akong ginapaningkamutan, kaning train gikan diri sa siyudad padulong sa Bunawan, Panabo siguro, unya mukatkat ngadto sa kampo sa NPA. Magbuhat og terminal ngadto.Musurrender na man kaya mo? Oh. Wa man pud muangkon gud ninyo. Ang tinuod gud ana — ikaw Luis, wala gyud ka nagbinuang? Ikaw gagunit diha sa boundary eh.Hangtod karon, loyal pa ka? Maayo nang magklaro ta kay daghan pa kaayo ka’g armas eh. Naa pa ang armas? Basin giprenda, giinom lang nimong y***. Palahubog ka.Luis, pagtarong ha. Putlan tika’g ulo. Aha man ang armas ninyo ni kuan? Gihatag ni… naa pa? Oh, pabungol bungol ra ba. Ang armas na gihatag ni Ed, naa pa ba? Ang armas gihatag ni Ed? Wala? Wala na? Giprenda pud?Pareho ka anang sundalo? Muingon ug — niadto tung sundalo. “Sir, patulong ako.” “Bakit?” “Naprenda ko ‘yung…” “P***. Magkano ‘yung naprenda?” “Nanganak ‘yung akong kabit, sir.” Ay p***.Pagka. Kamong sundaluha mo, utro pud mo. Mao nang magtinabangay lang. Ayaw mo pag duol sa\\xa0[inaudible]\\xa0wala gyud mahitabo ninyo.Mag-sige lang mog patay. Inyong leader, wala sila. Kana sila, kuhaon.

       "'kindly sit down.i have a prepared speech here, two pages. but this kind of thing would not inspire me tonight if i do not give you my sentimiyento ko sa buhay.you know, when i was studying and lived in a dormitory and every time we get our key from the pigeon hole, i looked at that statement, it states there, ayon ang, hanggang ngayon, na memorize ko kasi araw araw kami. every time you get a message you go to the desk. so i’m staying just beside city hall, and it was a great dorm. marami kami doon halu halo, 400 of us. so more or less, you begin to interact with a lot of people, different religions and different tribes. so i maybe that was why i started my politics because i’m fond with just getting to know you and making friends.pero nung sa eleksyon, well, of course, i’ve been mayor of the city of davao for 23 years. that is why i’d more or less know about governance. but i hold it as an article of faith that no progress or development can come to a country or city unless there is law and order.just after the evolution of cory, there was already lawlessness in mindanao and in davao and well, i thought that maybe if i ran, i could improve the situation of my city where i grew up.so nung na presidente ako and i promised this: one, that there will be no corruption. and if it is there, then baka ginusto mo, you might want it. two, is that i have to stop drugs in this country. third, is criminality. because these are the three things that would really kill a nation. fourth, is i leave to the economicmanagers, of course, just create the environment where they can thrive peacefully and with the least intervention of government.as a matter of fact, ayaw kong makialam sa mga negosyo. for one thing or another, a lot of reasons – harassment that’s why i said to this government na kayong, those of you who are joining me, kindly be reminded of my words.so a lot of things have happened our will of late and to think i am just about how many months in the office, i have fired almost 92 people from the regulatory bodies ltfrb, lahat yan and we have an impasse with the people of the erc because they have refused to step down.you know, ako yung government worker. i am in charge of protecting public interest. ngayon, how can i trust you when you are already there, fixing the rates of the electricity that the people use? how can i be sure now that we are not shortchanged, that the public is suffering actually because of these rates? i don’t mind if it’s really a finding that is factual and true, wala akong problema diyan. but if i suspect that you there on the take, eh you better resign.hindi tayo magkakaintindihan diyan eh. then, hindi harassment, but i would withhold the money or request congress to dissolve the regulatory board. hindi ako pwedeng ganun kasi sa awa ng diyos, wala naman akong pinipili.you know, i was able to survive on a shoestring budget and i’m a public official for 40 years. we can survive with our salaries here, much bigger. ako about, i get 30 130,000. pero kulang talaga because i have two families to support .one is that i got an annulment from the first, my first wife. so itong sila mayor pati si ano. itong isa naman, isa lang. pero talagang kulang. sasabihin ko sa inyo ang totoo ha. makinig kayo, ma’am, tumingin ka sakin, ayaw mong tumingin sa akin eh. you know, kung magtanong ka kung maligaya ako, totohanan talaga to. i am talking live to eh all throughout the country.i never expected really to win i was there for just the challenge of it. but when i was looking at the other candidates, nobody was talking about mindanao. the serious problem actually is mindanao because if we don’t handle it very carefully, this country will end up dismembered. maniwala kayo sa akin.kaya sinabi ko kay sakur, you have to finish this. sabi ko, good luck. sabi ni sakur, pag nahulog itong helicopter na ito, tapos na ang lahat, magkakaproblema na tayo.’well, because i said i was able to talk to misuari. although he’s outside of the country, he’s really taking stock of everything. okay, he’s willing to talk to us. the mi, we’re having the first round officially next year, with jesus dureza here, secretary sa peace process. at i hope, i said that before the year ends, something concrete and positive will come out.and ito ang gusto kong sabihin sa bayan: you have to heed us people, guys from mindanao because we are telling you the truth, you have to really transform this country.one of a unitary type because there’s so much control is like the imperial throne because down the line, to the last treasurer or to the last assessor comes from malacañan or from the civil service or whoever you wants i get to get appointed. kailangan mo lahat na pati yung pera namin and the fact is talagang it is not divided equally.of course, we are not as prosperous as the other places of the philippines but still we’re taxpayers and we’re contributing a lot. remember that 54 percent, lahat ng mga exporter, 54 percent of the total export earnings of this country comes from mindanao. so pag ka ganun then every election meron dito, a favored few. and they elect the president in this they meet in one of four of them, five. so mahirap yan.because in the system, no fault for theirs but, i mean, you decide because nandito lahat eh and it cannot last long, not forever, i suppose.maniwala kayo kasi pag hindi, talagang there will never be an end to violence there. why? i’ll tell you what’s the secret. how to understand it?actually they started, they are not playing rebels just rebels because they just want to fight. tatanong ka, ano ba yan sila, bakit gustong patayan lahat?you know, and even the scholars of the moro. this is actually a moro nationalism. people of mindanao, of muslim faith are really called moro. ito sila ang nauna sa mindanao because 100 years before magellan landed in leyte, bringing with him the religion, christianity, sulu or and mindanao were already converted to islam ahead by 100 years.so with magellan forced his way into the country and subdued us. they got a nice place because they found in mindanao, just like the americans, that there was no typhoon.that fact of being knowledgeable in the wind currents, alam na nila noon kasi walang bagyo dito sa mindanao. that is why the when it was opened by the americans, go to mindanao because it is the land of promise, actually it was just sloganeering.before, dito kasi ang bureau of lands, centuries ago. and the huge map of the philippines was here and they divided mindanao and i cannot blame them because there were no people at that time. yung ditong mga tagalog ang nabigyan. pare, meron doon. we are trying to divide mindanao. you might want a 24 hour’ – di ba 24 hour yung seven homestead? those of pati yung torrens title was introduced by the americans.now, early on they wanted to develop the americans but they could not find the workers because the moro would not want to work for the americans who were caucasians. and rightly so, the moro really said that you are invading my country. and so they revolted against the spaniards. the most that they could do yung, was really yung spaniards to build the, or built the fort pilar to stop the inroads of the missionaries coming from malaysia, indonesia going up to mindanao. iyon ang nangyari.so they fought the spaniards, they fought the americans and they are fighting us. why? because of this nationalism. kanila itong mindanao pati sulu. walang kristiyanos noon. everybody – anak o ano ka anak ka ng whether the moro of davao is kalagan, kagan, sama, jolohano, tausug, maguindanao, iranun, those were the guys. they’re all muslims.so now, we are in a bind because here is the philippines, here is mindanao, the christians lording it over the muslim populations kasi kokonti lang. and even in my city it’s about 17, but we cannot really blame them. and so we have to ask for an arrangement where we can live peacefully and live comfortably. so how do we get it? you listen to them.now there’s a the barest minimum for misuari, murad of the milf and the rest is really federalism. then itong mga violent groups, the maute and itong si mga abu sayyaf, we’ll just have to talk or if it is really a problem also of the leaders of the moro. but at least we give them the hope. importante yan eh. you give them hope so that when we go to federalism, it is gonna be something like this.ngayon kasi, mayor or president, yun. mayor, governor, ito yung, these are the powers one, two three, four. iyong 5,6,7 wala diyan na nakalagay. those powers residual goes to the national, dilg.ang federal hindi. these are the powers of the federal setup, presidente. ang wala diyan goes down. that is what you call devolution in its highest form. so may control sila wag mong pakialaman eh lupa nila yan eh.so if you have to contract with somebody else, let the foreigners in as long as there’s a safeguard on everything, taxes and all, wala tayong problema.ngayon, they say that duterte is pushing for the federalism because he wanted to stay in power beyond six years. ladies and gentlemen, may i give you my word of honor, if they can craft, because they have to provide for a strong president because of the distribution of the islands, delikado ka kung a parliament just like the british, when it they were first struck with the violent, yung double decker nila sumabog. it’s a consensual body. eh ang ano nila, hindi pa malaman kung ano. but you know, you have strong presidential like france.you can have a parliament but reserved some powers although very few to call for an election, to dissolve the parliament, to be the chief, commander in chief of all the armed forces.ibigay mo lang yan sa presidente, lima, anim, pito, ang lahat doon na sa baba. huwag mong pakialaman. let them enjoy the resources of their land.much of this have been taken over by us. kaya mga kristiyanos, mga negosyante. they own so much of the land but they are marginalized and they are into enclaves. they suppress a barangay here, a barangay there. but we have to change that, otherwise, if we do not go with the changing times, it will overtake us and nothing will happen to this country.now, the question i said of i am trying to figure out how to me? if you can craft the federal type government next year and submit it to the people for ratification, whether you really and if it passes the verdict of the people, i am going to step down. next year tapos yan lahat, tapos na ako, i give you my word, my guarantee that it will happen.baba na ako, para walang masabi yung tao na, ah, duterte ’ if you do not believe me, hindi ka talaga bilib sa akin. maski anuhin mo. actually, pero kung magandang babae ka, hindi kita hintuan. kung hindi mo ako sagutin. ma’am, pag hindi mo patayin kita.’ so ganon. i leave you that message for mindanao. it’s actually a moro nationalism. eh yan yung mga abusador, as they fringes of a violent world. they are not really these are not really the activities the core of the problem. the core of the problem is we have to have a balance here.the fact that they are willing to go federal, it means to say that they will accept us. that they will accept hindi ako, kasi ako mestizo ako eh.i’m half chinese, half ano ko. maranao ang lola ko. but visayan yung tatay ko, cebu. pero, i’m giving you it’s not an ambition. wala akong ambition diyan. really if you ask me, sabihin ko nga e, may i pour out itong sentimiyento.you think that it’s make me happy that are you happy? ayan si , she was with me for the last 30 years. siya yung sa davao. ambisyosa ako, sabi ko na, am i happy with this?i will answer you this, hindi ko kailangan ang trabahong ito. i will repeat: hindi ko kailangan ang trabahong ito.so that you fix a new constitution, a new set up, make the moro happy. and if it’s a question of a people making a doubt or a because i am there. di ako ganon. on the third year, the half of my term of six years, i’ll step down. inyo na, kung sino yung presidente. walang problema yan.now, sa drugs. it’s an election promise. aside from my experience as 40 years as a congressman and vice mayor, mayor ng davao city.alam mo, fiscal ako. that makes up the 40 years in government service. fiscal ako, alam ko ang takbo, whether it’s really on trial, mabili mo eh. you can buy the policeman, some are corrupt to the core, prosecutors, judges, and even the prison facility.you can operate your shabu operation inside despite na merong nilagay na jammer. so nandiyan ka na sa loob ng presohan, then you are still f***** us. p****** i**. nasaan yung?ito marami rin ito pero, marami itong itong nagdadala, maraming pag ibig to. look at it. general loot. statements of assets and liabilities, 100 million. kasi matiyaga daw siyang negosyante. ang ulol, bakakun pa, mayor ng you know ladies and gentlemen, this is the drug industry of the philippines. ayan mga pangalan. nandito, pulis, prosecutor, barangay captains marami, about 2,000 plus. they have contaminated the government for so long a time. we just did not realize it. hindi natin alam eh. susmaryosep.elected public official. ito babae pangalan nito eh. pero ito o, barangay captain, barangay captain, barangay captain, barangay captain, barang isauli ko na ito sa iyo, mag init lang ulo ko. salamat ha? aide ko yan. taga baguio yan. minsan marami mag sabi, maganda lagi yung aide mo’. sabi ko, g***. hindi ako nag ano ng subordinate ko.’ i don’t that’s not my habit.ito ngayon ang human rights. well, perfectly all right to criticize me. the first survey during the time of general santiago, pdea, pegged it at three million.during my time, i’m still counting. hindi ko pa na release because i’m hitting the 900,000 mark. i know that i will breach that number before the year ends to another one million.so dito muna tayo sa three million. nandiyan na yan. itong 100 itong 1,000. sabi ko when i became president, you stop it or i’ll kill you. do not destroy my country. do not destroy the young because you will deprive us of a generation of filipinos. you do that, i will kill you.here comes now the human rights. eh maraming patay. actually, surprise of all surprises, we did not begin to operate until after i was two months in the office.if you’ll try to recall, weeks before i assumed the office, there were already many killings and right after i was elected. and yet we were not about to start anything. sabi ko, pag aralan natin ang terrain.because sa davao, alam ko, it was a serious i never thought na nong kung ano, when i started to squeeze everybody, to my horror, hundreds of thousands of filipinos were lining, the barangay hall, sa police, mag surrender and it has reached the 900 million.if you are a president of a country with four million shabu addicts. and to think that if you are into that practice, it’s the west who made that study, that say that shabu user for over a year would shrink his brain and he is permanently destroyed. no hope of rehabilitation.so how many of this four million now are really totally disabled? and how many are still maybe sane enough to be cured?kaya ako nagwawala. that is why there’s a rage inside me. can you possibly do it? by what right do you have in this universe, to destroy my daughter or my son na wala naman akong ginawa sa’yo? especially those working in the middle east, working their ass to death. yung isa nasa qatar ang asawa, yung asawa niya nasa saudi. they keep on sending money. working to no end only to find out that the son has been contaminated with shabu and the daughter is also an addict.so papano yan? where is forget about the laws. by what right do you have to do that? anong kasalan ng nanay pati tatay na gawain mo sa isang anak nila?kaya ako, kung ako ang tatay, anak ng anak ng p******* i** papatayin talaga kita, honestly. sus.papaano yang ano tapos itong human rights, well, it is good, what i said, they were already crying when it was not our job to do it, because i said not now, we have to study the terrain.and, you have this odicta, who were holding the western visayas. mag asawa. both husband and wife were shot down in the pier. and we keep on coming about human rights, human rights.i said, you know, i did not have the money eh. i entered midterm. wala akong pera. so i just stood there swallowing the mga takot nila duterte. and came these foreigners. you know, mr. duterte, i will hail you to the international criminal court.’i’m about to raise the finger, about to give the dirty finger to you. you do not know. human rights, genocide is for the race or religion or a class of persons.you dumb idiots. the law does not refer or whatever that law is, it does not refer to criminals.c’mon man. shut up. akala ko ba graduate ka ng oxford, mga cambridge, mga harvard. tala tala pala kayo eh. mabuti pa ako dito local lang. i mean if it is not if it is not a crime in my country, to say, if you destroy my country, i will kill you. if it is not a crime to state bluntly to you, do not deprive us of the young of the next generation. it is not a crime to say that, who are you stupid fool to say that to me? yung mga eu, mga abugado nila. that this mayor has been heard openly to kill criminals. god. shut up.do your worse. wala akong pakialam sa inyo. and this rapporteur, threatening to come. sabi ko, come, and said she wants a one on one meeting, sabi ko no’. you do it in public. i’ll tell you where your garbage comes from. iyong babae, come.i’ll place a table there, small table and face to face. let the filipino here it. if it is a crime eh di sige. tanong ko lang naman sa kanya. well, you came here with facts, factual, or you are here to confront me with a garbage? i will just simply say, who was my 50th victim? what is her name? and how old was she? and where did this happen?so, 5,000. so yung ika 5,000 sino iyon? anong pangalan niya? gaga ka pala eh. ganoon lang ako. i tend to be you know i am. basta pinikon mo ako. i meet to you that kind of i come from a level of civilization na hindi naman masyadong ano. eh probinsiyano lang nga ako eh.i just came from a province. though i am part of the establishment because of being a lawyer but i came in from the cold. i was not the one pareha nito kilala lahat. and yet i won. so i said what is this? i asked my wife. there’s something there that, you know.you got a four million. ulitin ko. dalawa lang presidente ko. si imee marcos already from mindanao. and she supported me. and i won in her province by almost 100,000. and only because she was once upon a time the love of my life. eh hindi ko alam itong life chapter chapter pala ito. hindi talaga life na totoo. that’s what i’ve said, god must have so that’s it. it will continue ang criminality. itong mga kidnappers dito sa malacañan. because shabu is on the way down. it’s a slowing down a bit. iyong iba are back into the business of kidnapping mostly chinese.what is really very despicable, hingian nila ng ransom tapos patayin pa nila. do you think that i’m happy? basta you know, you do your thing, i do my thing. if we meet in one corner, pasensiya. ganon ang pilipino eh.now, i am trying kasi hindi i already. i am serious asking i can ever be. kayong mga foreigners diyan, you are better off going to the communities telling them stop it because you’ll lose not only your pants but your life.ang sa akin you want the killings stop? tell the shabu producer and runners, stop shabu and there will be peace in the land.’you continue with shabu. i will not. until the last pusher i said is out of the streets. until the last drug lord is killed, it will last till the end of my term of six years kung nandiyan ako.if i have to resign or step down or if i am assassinated, go ahead. ousted, impeached, go ahead. as long as the people would know that i give up the presidency not because of corruption because i was desperate in trying to help my country preserve its simple as that. i have no plans of mine, personal? wala na. if you ask me if i’m happy, extra happy to be president? i’ll answer you – i do not need it.and so for the businessman, all you have to do is to assert. if the son of a b*** will tell you demanding money, sampalin mo and make an appointment with me to bong go. and i will take care of them. whoever it is.i fired the other day two commissioners of the immigration and to tell you they were my fraternity brothers. so talagang eh wala akong magawa eh. may usapan tayo dito. huwag na kayong magpunta ng ombudsman diretso kayo sa akin.totoo, honestly, patawag ko dito. sipain ko iyan sa harap mo. then i will demand for the resignation. pag hindi i will treat you as a drug pusher also. totoo. ganon na lang. ganon naman talaga ang style ko rin sa davao.you know davao is hitting nine. the highest growth in the philippines, nine. why? because davao is peaceful. it bloomed flower to the something really big. there is a shrine there, it’s at the mountain actually. then if you are there in the middle then you can look at your right side and it would be something like the west and the east dito kita mo ang development ng davao. so everybody is happy. and there is no. there is enough job there. you cannot find anymore. iyong because a plumber has to be a plumber. you cannot be a carpenter. or the carpenter can do this the carpentry works. most of our skilled are in you know what they say when i go there, mayor, we are just hoping and praying that some day if you can fix our country that we can go home and work there and be with our childen.’every i hear those words. every time magtake off ako galing laos, vietnam, for if not for the so many guys there sa eroplano, gusto kong umiyak. gusto kong umiyak. makikita ko back home i have to face the problem of law and order, drugs, abu sayyaf, and maute. and they were trying to mount a revolution there. and i said, be careful because if they lose the land mass, the aleppo or the mosul and their desired proclamation of a caliphate nasabi ko na ba that would be malaysia, indonesia and the philippines and brunei.then there’s gonna be real trouble for this country. i hope it would not reach that but isis is very dangerous. i have a mixed blood but i cannot condone their barbaric. you know, if you have to kill a person, you do not have to do that.you should be inspired by the song . they just lie there and they die there. no need for you to make an exhibit about cutting the head of a poor guy.so that’s my friends are, actually my thank you for listening to my outpouring of a what and were it not for a very receptive pero yung totoo, from the heart. if you do not agree with me fine, i will not take it against you. but do not engage me in like question of law. i should know what i’m doing, i never declared i said, i never declared police punitive action.right on start i says, i’m going to wage a war because the casualty now is four million. do i need another year and be afraid of human rights and all of these things? and you are isang ito pang gago na mamatay. assuming na ano pinatay yan. sabi ko assuming it to be true, but i said i believe in the version of the police because the police is under me and the justice department is also is under me.if i really wanted to cover up, all i have to do is to say to the agents of the nbi, which is under the justice department, to just follow the theory of the police. they are all theories, no direct witnesses. i said i just file the case. but i will not, i will not for the if it, if it they said proven to me after that investigation report i’ll wait to read it, that they followed my orders go out arrest them. but if they do not are surrender and they present a violent resistance putting in jeopardy the life of the lawman, shoot the idiot. that is my order. and if you get charge in court, tell the judge, i will appear there. it is my sole singular criminal responsibility not theirs. they are just following orders.if it’s really consider the crime say you, i destroy you, then go ahead. but it is not in the revised penal code or nowhere in the books of penal statutes of ours. so i said, republic of the philippines go for the federal type maybe a not so broad one. you the united states were here, they were lord it over for 50 years and live up with the fat of the land. but there they went out, it’s still, it was still a unitary type. and to hear them say, we will cut your aid if these things happen again.’ go on, shut up, shut up.i do not need your assistance, challenge millennium challenge, 400 million? china is going to release to me 50 billion, go home, i do not need your aid.you know, you should careful with orientals. they just don’t know how to treat themselves. when you tie the when there is a, you say we will not give you because of this. you are pictured, it is a visayan idiom, i don’t know if you can understand . patay gutom is a your dead because your hungry. we don’t care if you are dead because your of starvation. it’s actually is slur. do not if you are dealing with asians with due respect to the ambassador of united states. you are dealing with asians be careful of your language. you could not do that to the japanese and to the koreans and to the they feel insulted.why do have to say, we will cut your aid.’ just say outright, please stop or this we are members of the united nations, correct? okay. you guys put your complaint there for the violations of the lost souls.then whatever happens there, the human rights commission can conduct an investigation. then if there is our finding, then go ahead and present it to plenary and then they come to me and say confront me, what is this. but just to say, you come to here to investigate me and to talk to me, no. i my transactions, i do not want dealings here. i do not want to talk about business. there’s the undersecretary of trade, and there’s other secretary, you go them. no i have to review the papers of every almost everyday.i it’s actually at the end of the day, i would say to you, it is dignity. just because there are human rights violations, you do not say that you will never have the aids. we do not need it.bakit sabihin mo pa? mr. duterte, if this thing continues, you’ll lose the assistance.’ it is actually an insult. so i hope that we can understand each other here and you guys.and there will never be a time that i will allow government people to go into your pockets. that’s why i ordered the arrest of jack lam. i really not know what was the case against him but he was talking as if he was everybody in government was in his pocket.and so i called bong, arrest him’. for what?’ for whatever’ good that he was able to fly out or he will rot in jail. and they said, there is no charge’. no, never mind. you arrest him.’ god.and may i say also, sorry for my bad words. i was not disciplined enough by my father and mother but do not consider me i’ll rehash it, huwag na tayong .let us not kid each other. i am a worker of government. i never said a word about me as president.you have never heard me say, well as president, i would say as a worker of this government. but yung sabihin mo, elected as president, i have to do this because i have to protect the filipino. i have to preserve the country. it’s actually a self preservation thing. it does not need any constitution to say to protect your people.maraming salamat po. comments'"

       "'kindly sit down.\\ni have a prepared speech here, two pages. but this kind of thing would not inspire me tonight if i do not give you my sentimiyento ko sa buhay.\\nyou know, when i was studying and lived in a dormitory and every time we get our key from the pigeon hole, i looked at that statement, it states there, \\nayon ang, hanggang ngayon, na memorize ko kasi araw araw kami. every time you get a message you go to the desk. so i’m staying just beside city hall, and it was a great dorm. marami kami doon halu halo, 400 of us. so more or less, you begin to interact with a lot of people, different religions and different tribes. so i maybe that was why i started my politics because i’m fond with just getting to know you and making friends.\\npero nung sa eleksyon, well, of course, i’ve been mayor of the city of davao for 23 years. that is why i’d more or less know about governance. but i hold it as an article of faith that no progress or development can come to a country or city unless there is law and order.\\njust after the evolution of cory, there was already lawlessness in mindanao and in davao and well, i thought that maybe if i ran, i could improve the situation of my city where i grew up.\\nso nung na presidente ako and i promised this: one, that there will be no corruption. and if it is there, then baka ginusto mo, you might want it. two, is that i have to stop drugs in this country. third, is criminality. because these are the three things that would really kill a nation. fourth, is i leave to the economic managers, of course, just create the environment where they can thrive peacefully and with the least intervention of government.\\nas a matter of fact, ayaw kong makialam sa mga negosyo. for one thing or another, a lot of reasons – harassment that’s why i said to this government na kayong, those of you who are joining me, kindly be reminded of my words.\\nso a lot of things have happened our will of late and to think i am just about how many months in the office, i have fired almost 92 people from the regulatory bodies ltfrb, lahat yan and we have an impasse with the people of the erc because they have refused to step down.\\nyou know, ako yung government worker. i am in charge of protecting public interest. ngayon, how can i trust you when you are already there, fixing the rates of the electricity that the people use? how can i be sure now that we are not shortchanged, that the public is suffering actually because of these rates? i don’t mind if it’s really a finding that is factual and true, wala akong problema diyan. but if i suspect that you there on the take, eh you better resign.\\nhindi tayo magkakaintindihan diyan eh. then, hindi harassment, but i would withhold the money or request congress to dissolve the regulatory board. hindi ako pwedeng ganun kasi sa awa ng diyos, wala naman akong pinipili.\\nyou know, i was able to survive on a shoestring budget and i’m a public official for 40 years. we can survive with our salaries here, much bigger. ako about, i get 30 130,000. pero kulang talaga because i have two families to support .\\none is that i got an annulment from the first, my first wife. so itong sila mayor pati si ano. itong isa naman, isa lang. pero talagang kulang. sasabihin ko sa inyo ang totoo ha. makinig kayo, ma’am, tumingin ka sakin, ayaw mong tumingin sa akin eh. \\nyou know, kung magtanong ka kung maligaya ako, totohanan talaga to. i am talking live to eh all throughout the country.\\ni never expected really to win i was there for just the challenge of it. but when i was looking at the other candidates, nobody was talking about mindanao. the serious problem actually is mindanao because if we don’t handle it very carefully, this country will end up dismembered. maniwala kayo sa akin.\\nkaya sinabi ko kay sakur, you have to finish this. sabi ko, good luck. sabi ni sakur, pag nahulog itong helicopter na ito, tapos na ang lahat, magkakaproblema na tayo.’\\nwell, because i said i was able to talk to misuari. although he’s outside of the country, he’s really taking stock of everything. okay, he’s willing to talk to us. the mi, we’re having the first round officially next year, with jesus dureza here, secretary sa peace process. at i hope, i said that before the year ends, something concrete and positive will come out.\\nand ito ang gusto kong sabihin sa bayan: you have to heed us people, guys from mindanao because we are telling you the truth, you have to really transform this country.\\none of a unitary type because there’s so much control is like the imperial throne because down the line, to the last treasurer or to the last assessor comes from malacañan or from the civil service or whoever you wants i get to get appointed. kailangan mo lahat na pati yung pera namin and the fact is talagang it is not divided equally.\\nof course, we are not as prosperous as the other places of the philippines but still we’re taxpayers and we’re contributing a lot. remember that 54 percent, lahat ng mga exporter, 54 percent of the total export earnings of this country comes from mindanao. so pag ka ganun \\nthen every election meron dito, a favored few. and they elect the president in this they meet in one of four of them, five. so mahirap yan.\\nbecause in the system, no fault for theirs but, i mean, you decide because nandito lahat eh and it cannot last long, not forever, i suppose.\\nmaniwala kayo kasi pag hindi, talagang there will never be an end to violence there. why? i’ll tell you what’s the secret. how to understand it?\\nactually they started, they are not playing rebels just rebels because they just want to fight. tatanong ka, ano ba yan sila, bakit gustong patayan lahat?\\nyou know, and even the scholars of the moro. this is actually a moro nationalism. people of mindanao, of muslim faith are really called moro. ito sila ang nauna sa mindanao because 100 years before magellan landed in leyte, bringing with him the religion, christianity, sulu or and mindanao were already converted to islam ahead by 100 years.\\nso with magellan forced his way into the country and subdued us. they got a nice place because they found in mindanao, just like the americans, that there was no typhoon.\\nthat fact of being knowledgeable in the wind currents, alam na nila noon kasi walang bagyo dito sa mindanao. that is why the when it was opened by the americans, go to mindanao because it is the land of promise, actually it was just sloganeering.\\nbefore, dito kasi ang bureau of lands, centuries ago. and the huge map of the philippines was here and they divided mindanao and i cannot blame them because there were no people at that time. yung ditong mga tagalog ang nabigyan. pare, meron doon. we are trying to divide mindanao. you might want a 24 hour’ – di ba 24 hour yung seven homestead? those of pati yung torrens title was introduced by the americans.\\nnow, early on they wanted to develop the americans but they could not find the workers because the moro would not want to work for the americans who were caucasians. and rightly so, the moro really said that you are invading my country. and so they revolted against the spaniards. the most that they could do yung, was really yung spaniards to build the, or built the fort pilar to stop the inroads of the missionaries coming from malaysia, indonesia going up to mindanao. iyon ang nangyari.\\nso they fought the spaniards, they fought the americans and they are fighting us. why? because of this nationalism. kanila itong mindanao pati sulu. walang kristiyanos noon. everybody – anak o ano ka anak ka ng whether the moro of davao is kalagan, kagan, sama, jolohano, tausug, maguindanao, iranun, those were the guys. they’re all muslims.\\nso now, we are in a bind because here is the philippines, here is mindanao, the christians lording it over the muslim populations kasi kokonti lang. and even in my city it’s about 17, but we cannot really blame them. and so we have to ask for an arrangement where we can live peacefully and live comfortably. so how do we get it? you listen to them.\\nnow there’s a the barest minimum for misuari, murad of the milf and the rest is really federalism. then itong mga violent groups, the maute and itong si mga abu sayyaf, we’ll just have to talk or if it is really a problem also of the leaders of the moro. but at least we give them the hope. importante yan eh. you give them hope so that when we go to federalism, it is gonna be something like this.\\nngayon kasi, mayor or president, yun. mayor, governor, ito yung, these are the powers one, two three, four. iyong 5,6,7 wala diyan na nakalagay. those powers residual goes to the national, dilg.\\nang federal hindi. these are the powers of the federal setup, presidente. ang wala diyan goes down. that is what you call devolution in its highest form. so may control sila wag mong pakialaman eh lupa nila yan eh.\\nso if you have to contract with somebody else, let the foreigners in as long as there’s a safeguard on everything, taxes and all, wala tayong problema.\\nngayon, they say that duterte is pushing for the federalism because he wanted to stay in power beyond six years. ladies and gentlemen, may i give you my word of honor, if they can craft, because they have to provide for a strong president because of the distribution of the islands, delikado ka kung a parliament just like the british, when it they were first struck with the violent, yung double decker nila sumabog. it’s a consensual body. eh ang ano nila, hindi pa malaman kung ano. but you know, you have strong presidential like france.\\nyou can have a parliament but reserved some powers although very few to call for an election, to dissolve the parliament, to be the chief, commander in chief of all the armed forces.\\nibigay mo lang yan sa presidente, lima, anim, pito, ang lahat doon na sa baba. huwag mong pakialaman. let them enjoy the resources of their land.\\nmuch of this have been taken over by us. kaya mga kristiyanos, mga negosyante. they own so much of the land but they are marginalized and they are into enclaves. they suppress a barangay here, a barangay there. but we have to change that, otherwise, if we do not go with the changing times, it will overtake us and nothing will happen to this country.\\nnow, the question i said of i am trying to figure out how to me? if you can craft the federal type government next year and submit it to the people for ratification, whether you really and if it passes the verdict of the people, i am going to step down. next year tapos yan lahat, tapos na ako, i give you my word, my guarantee that it will happen.\\nbaba na ako, para walang masabi yung tao na, ah, duterte ’ if you do not believe me, hindi ka talaga bilib sa akin. maski anuhin mo. \\nactually, pero kung magandang babae ka, hindi kita hintuan. kung hindi mo ako sagutin. ma’am, pag hindi mo patayin kita.’ \\nso ganon. i leave you that message for mindanao. it’s actually a moro nationalism. eh yan yung mga abusador, as they fringes of a violent world. they are not really these are not really the activities the core of the problem. the core of the problem is we have to have a balance here.\\nthe fact that they are willing to go federal, it means to say that they will accept us. that they will accept hindi ako, kasi ako mestizo ako eh.\\ni’m half chinese, half ano ko. maranao ang lola ko. but visayan yung tatay ko, cebu. pero, i’m giving you it’s not an ambition. wala akong ambition diyan. really if you ask me, sabihin ko nga e, may i pour out itong sentimiyento.\\nyou think that it’s make me happy that are you happy? ayan si , she was with me for the last 30 years. siya yung sa davao. ambisyosa ako, sabi ko na, am i happy with this?\\ni will answer you this, hindi ko kailangan ang trabahong ito. i will repeat: hindi ko kailangan ang trabahong ito.\\nso that you fix a new constitution, a new set up, make the moro happy. and if it’s a question of a people making a doubt or a because i am there. di ako ganon.\\non the third year, the half of my term of six years, i’ll step down. inyo na, kung sino yung presidente. walang problema yan.\\nnow, sa drugs. it’s an election promise. aside from my experience as 40 years as a congressman and vice mayor, mayor ng davao city.\\nalam mo, fiscal ako. that makes up the 40 years in government service. fiscal ako, alam ko ang takbo, whether it’s really on trial, mabili mo eh. you can buy the policeman, some are corrupt to the core, prosecutors, judges, and even the prison facility.\\nyou can operate your shabu operation inside despite na merong nilagay na jammer. so nandiyan ka na sa loob ng presohan, then you are still f***** us. p****** i**. nasaan yung?\\nito marami rin ito pero, marami itong itong nagdadala, maraming pag ibig to. \\nlook at it. general loot. statements of assets and liabilities, 100 million. kasi matiyaga daw siyang negosyante. ang ulol, bakakun pa, mayor ng \\nyou know ladies and gentlemen, this is the drug industry of the philippines. ayan mga pangalan. nandito, pulis, prosecutor, barangay captains marami, about 2,000 plus. they have contaminated the government for so long a time. we just did not realize it. hindi natin alam eh. susmaryosep.\\nelected public official. ito babae pangalan nito eh. pero ito o, barangay captain, barangay captain, barangay captain, barangay captain, barang isauli ko na ito sa iyo, mag init lang ulo ko. \\nsalamat ha? aide ko yan. taga baguio yan. minsan marami mag sabi, maganda lagi yung aide mo’. sabi ko, g***. hindi ako nag ano ng subordinate ko.’ i don’t that’s not my habit.\\nito ngayon ang human rights. well, perfectly all right to criticize me. the first survey during the time of general santiago, pdea, pegged it at three million.\\nduring my time, i’m still counting. hindi ko pa na release because i’m hitting the 900,000 mark. i know that i will breach that number before the year ends to another one million.\\nso dito muna tayo sa three million. nandiyan na yan. itong 100 itong 1,000. sabi ko when i became president, you stop it or i’ll kill you. do not destroy my country. do not destroy the young because you will deprive us of a generation of filipinos. you do that, i will kill you.\\nhere comes now the human rights. eh maraming patay. actually, surprise of all surprises, we did not begin to operate until after i was two months in the office.\\nif you’ll try to recall, weeks before i assumed the office, there were already many killings and right after i was elected. and yet we were not about to start anything. sabi ko, pag aralan natin ang terrain.\\nbecause sa davao, alam ko, it was a serious i never thought na nong kung ano, when i started to squeeze everybody, to my horror, hundreds of thousands of filipinos were lining, the barangay hall, sa police, mag surrender and it has reached the 900 million.\\nif you are a president of a country with four million shabu addicts. and to think that if you are into that practice, it’s the west who made that study, that say that shabu user for over a year would shrink his brain and he is permanently destroyed. no hope of rehabilitation.\\nso how many of this four million now are really totally disabled? and how many are still maybe sane enough to be cured?\\nkaya ako nagwawala. that is why there’s a rage inside me. can you possibly do it? by what right do you have in this universe, to destroy my daughter or my son na wala naman akong ginawa sa’yo? especially those working in the middle east, working their ass to death. yung isa nasa qatar ang asawa, yung asawa niya nasa saudi. they keep on sending money. working to no end only to find out that the son has been contaminated with shabu and the daughter is also an addict.\\nso papano yan? where is forget about the laws. by what right do you have to do that? anong kasalan ng nanay pati tatay na gawain mo sa isang anak nila?\\nkaya ako, kung ako ang tatay, anak ng anak ng p******* i** papatayin talaga kita, honestly. sus.\\npapaano yang ano tapos itong human rights, well, it is good, what i said, they were already crying when it was not our job to do it, because i said not now, we have to study the terrain.\\nand, you have this odicta, who were holding the western visayas. mag asawa. both husband and wife were shot down in the pier. and we keep on coming about human rights, human rights.\\ni said, you know, i did not have the money eh. i entered midterm. wala akong pera. so i just stood there swallowing the mga takot nila duterte. and came these foreigners. you know, mr. duterte, i will hail you to the international criminal court.’\\ni’m about to raise the finger, about to give the dirty finger to you. you do not know. human rights, genocide is for the race or religion or a class of persons.\\nyou dumb idiots. the law does not refer or whatever that law is, it does not refer to criminals.\\nc’mon man. shut up. akala ko ba graduate ka ng oxford, mga cambridge, mga harvard. tala tala pala kayo eh. mabuti pa ako dito local lang. \\ni mean if it is not if it is not a crime in my country, to say, if you destroy my country, i will kill you. if it is not a crime to state bluntly to you, do not deprive us of the young of the next generation. it is not a crime to say that, who are you stupid fool to say that to me?\\n yung mga eu, mga abugado nila. that this mayor has been heard openly to kill criminals. god. shut up.\\ndo your worse. wala akong pakialam sa inyo. and this rapporteur, threatening to come. sabi ko, come, and said she wants a one on one meeting, sabi ko no’. you do it in public. i’ll tell you where your garbage comes from. iyong babae, come.\\ni’ll place a table there, small table and face to face. let the filipino here it. if it is a crime eh di sige. tanong ko lang naman sa kanya. well, you came here with facts, factual, or you are here to confront me with a garbage?

basta you know, you do your thing, i do my thing. if we meet in one corner, pasensiya. ganon ang pilipino eh.\\nnow, i am trying kasi hindi i already. i am serious asking i can ever be. kayong mga foreigners diyan, you are better off going to the communities telling them stop it because you’ll lose not only your pants but your life.\\nang sa akin you want the killings stop? tell the shabu producer and runners, stop shabu and there will be peace in the land.’\\nyou continue with shabu. i will not. until the last pusher i said is out of the streets. until the last drug lord is killed, it will last till the end of my term of six years kung nandiyan ako.\\nif i have to resign or step down or if i am assassinated, go ahead. ousted, impeached, go ahead. as long as the people would know that i give up the presidency not because of corruption because i was desperate in trying to help my country preserve its \\nsimple as that. i have no plans of mine, personal? wala na. if you ask me if i’m happy, extra happy to be president? i’ll answer you – i do not need it.\\nand so for the businessman, all you have to do is to assert. if the son of a b*** will tell you demanding money, sampalin mo and make an appointment with me to bong go. and i will take care of them. whoever it is.\\ni fired the other day two commissioners of the immigration and to tell you they were my fraternity brothers. so talagang eh wala akong magawa eh. may usapan tayo dito. huwag na kayong magpunta ng ombudsman diretso kayo sa akin.\\ntotoo, honestly, patawag ko dito. sipain ko iyan sa harap mo. then i will demand for the resignation. pag hindi i will treat you as a drug pusher also. totoo. ganon na lang. ganon naman talaga ang style ko rin sa davao.\\nyou know davao is hitting nine. the highest growth in the philippines, nine. why? because davao is peaceful. it bloomed flower to the something really big. there is a shrine there, it’s at the mountain actually. then if you are there in the middle then you can look at your right side and it would be something like the west and the east dito kita mo ang development ng davao. so everybody is happy. and there is no. there is enough job there. you cannot find anymore. iyong because a plumber has to be a plumber. you cannot be a carpenter. or the carpenter can do this the carpentry works. most of our skilled are in \\nyou know what they say when i go there, mayor, we are just hoping and praying that some day if you can fix our country that we can go home and work there and be with our childen.’\\nevery i hear those words. every time magtake off ako galing laos, vietnam, for if not for the so many guys there sa eroplano, gusto kong umiyak. gusto kong umiyak. makikita ko back home i have to face the problem of law and order, drugs, abu sayyaf, and maute. and they were trying to mount a revolution there. and i said, be careful because if they lose the land mass, the aleppo or the mosul and their desired proclamation of a caliphate nasabi ko na ba that would be malaysia, indonesia and the philippines and brunei.\\nthen there’s gonna be real trouble for this country. i hope it would not reach that but isis is very dangerous. i have a mixed blood but i cannot condone their barbaric. you know, if you have to kill a person, you do not have to do that.\\nyou should be inspired by the song . they just lie there and they die there. no need for you to make an exhibit about cutting the head of a poor guy.\\nso that’s my friends are, actually my thank you for listening to my outpouring of a what \\nand were it not for a very receptive pero yung totoo, from the heart. if you do not agree with me fine, i will not take it against you. but do not engage me in like question of law. i should know what i’m doing, i never declared i said, i never declared police punitive action.\\nright on start i says, i’m going to wage a war because the casualty now is four million. do i need another year and be afraid of human rights and all of these things? and you are isang ito pang gago na mamatay. assuming na ano pinatay yan. sabi ko assuming it to be true, but i said i believe in the version of the police because the police is under me and the justice department is also is under me.\\nif i really wanted to cover up, all i have to do is to say to the agents of the nbi, which is under the justice department, to just follow the theory of the police. they are all theories, no direct witnesses. i said i just file the case. but i will not, i will not for the if it, if it they said proven to me after that investigation report i’ll wait to read it, that they followed my orders go out arrest them. but if they do not are surrender and they present a violent resistance putting in jeopardy the life of the lawman, shoot the idiot. that is my order. and if you get charge in court, tell the judge, i will appear there. it is my sole singular criminal responsibility not theirs. they are just following orders.\\nif it’s really consider the crime say you, i destroy you, then go ahead. but it is not in the revised penal code or nowhere in the books of penal statutes of ours. so i said, republic of the philippines go for the federal type maybe a not so broad one. you the united states were here, they were lord it over for 50 years and live up with the fat of the land. but there they went out, it’s still, it was still a unitary type. and to hear them say, we will cut your aid if these things happen again.’ go on, shut up, shut up.\\ni do not need your assistance, challenge millennium challenge, 400 million? china is going to release to me 50 billion, go home, i do not need your aid.\\nyou know, you should careful with orientals. they just don’t know how to treat themselves. when you tie the when there is a, you say we will not give you because of this. you are pictured, it is a visayan idiom, i don’t know if you can understand . patay gutom is a your dead because your hungry. we don’t care if you are dead because your of starvation. it’s actually is slur. do not if you are dealing with asians with due respect to the ambassador of united states. you are dealing with asians be careful of your language. you could not do that to the japanese and to the koreans and to the they feel insulted.\\nwhy do have to say, we will cut your aid.’ just say outright, please stop or this we are members of the united nations, correct? okay. you guys put your complaint there for the violations of the lost souls.\\nthen whatever happens there, the human rights commission can conduct an investigation. then if there is our finding, then go ahead and present it to plenary and then they come to me and say confront me, what is this. but just to say, you come to here to investigate me and to talk to me, no. i my transactions, i do not want dealings here. i do not want to talk about business. there’s the undersecretary of trade, and there’s other secretary, you go them. no i have to review the papers of every almost everyday.\\ni it’s actually at the end of the day, i would say to you, it is dignity. just because there are human rights violations, you do not say that you will never have the aids. we do not need it.\\nbakit sabihin mo pa? mr. duterte, if this thing continues, you’ll lose the assistance.’ it is actually an insult. so i hope that we can understand each other here and you guys.\\nand there will never be a time that i will allow government people to go into your pockets. that’s why i ordered the arrest of jack lam. i really not know what was the case against him but he was talking as if he was everybody in government was in his pocket.\\nand so i called bong, arrest him’. for what?’ for whatever’ good that he was able to fly out or he will rot in jail. and they said, there is no charge’. no, never mind. you arrest him.’ god.\\nand may i say also, sorry for my bad words. i was not disciplined enough by my father and mother but do not consider me i’ll rehash it, huwag na tayong .\\nlet us not kid each other. i am a worker of government. i never said a word about me as president.\\nyou have never heard me say, well as president, i would say as a worker of this government. but yung sabihin mo, elected as president, i have to do this because i have to protect the filipino. i have to preserve the country. it’s actually a self preservation thing. it does not need any constitution to say to protect your people.\\nmaraming salamat po.'"

      " during the sulong pilipinas: local governance series: lgu consultations on peace and order and social development with luzon local officials\n",
      " salamat po. kindly sit down. i dispense with the acknowledgements. may i address everybody, my co workers in government, ladies and gentlemen.alam natin ho lahat ang problema sa pilipinas and in my generation, ito ang pinaka mabigat. i’m about i’m on the sunset days of my life. i am politically dead after this term. i’ve nowhere to go but to retire and perhaps in the fullness of god’s time, i die early so that i can rest.ganito yan eh. i’d like to just give you a resumé of myself para you’d know where i come from. before i became mayor, i was a prosecutor in davao city. i was doing trial work for almost eight years and i became an oic vice mayor, eventually to run in 1988 elections. therefrom, hindi naman ako nag ano but i’ve been there for 23 years as mayor, congressman, and vice mayor to my daughter, inday. all throughout, it would be something like 40 years in the government service. nong piskal ho ako and because that was near, about the time shabu was making its entrance in the social scene. marami ho akong kaso na na dismiss because at that time katatapos lang ng martial law because of the cory administration.may mga kaso siguro akong, about 32 of them i remember, talagang bumagsak. because at that time, there was only one forensic analyst, a chemical engineer actually, assigned sa, itong forensics ngayon. and he had to take care about so many provinces under region 11. so at one time, cases were torn, but all the time he’s never there for the simple reason that he has to be in this province. ang subpoeana nauna and he cannot travel alone at that time except to wait for a convoy, either of the police or the philippine constabulary at that time before getting to travel.kasi pag natyambahan ka ng npa noon, either the buses are stopped suddenly, there’s a checkpoint and if you are there, goodbye. noon talagang pag nahuli ka, wala na yan. and i know that because i used to talk them and hinihingi ko minsan ang balato yung iba, but still lalo na pag ka even now. good that we have this moratorium, a respite of the fighting. yung, paksabi na–alam ninyo kayong may contact sa npa. pag ka intelligence officer yan, diretso yan. wala ng hindi mo na if you ask them, they would say wag na lang yan mayor, tapos na. basta intelligence officer, diretso yan, diretso na yan.he attempted na lumaban nang husto kasi ganon ang even right before the ceasefire. nong nag ceasefire tayo, i declared one earlier to show good faith on the part of the government. inambush naman ng buwang yung mga sundalo sa surigao banda, kaya ako nagalit. then nag away kami ni sison, professor, kilala kami. nagmurahan kami. sabi ko, ikaw nagpakita na nga ako ng magandang loob eh. but eventually they are now in oslo talking about peace.so marami akong bakante na sundalo at nai deploy ko sa mindanao. because doon sa jolo, we are battling it out with them.ganito yan eh. i am not a wartime president. i was elected in an environment where democracy was being played out. i am a president that would seek peace for my land.wala akong ambisyon na ipagpatuloy itong lahat na giyera because it could not only suck the human filipino spirit but everybody, lahat ng hatred would continue and continue and continue.nakipag usap ako sa npa, ndf sila, okay na tayo. i talked to murad, i talked to jaafar and yung central committee, i got a response, positive. despite the fact that murad earlier said that we’ll go to war if there is no bbl.sabi ko sir, ipag ano mo na muna, sabi ko sayang ang buhay, sayang talaga. and si nur naman, i just talked to him coming over here, and kung sinong kung kilala ni nur, the line was very bad, but i heard him saying that he’s going to go to me in davao but has to bring his troops as security.i could not explain to him that that could not be possible anymore. unang una, he is facing charges and if at all, he’s allowed to go out, lalo na hindi siya pwede magdala ng sarili niyang armas. ako, wala akong ano diyan eh. maski dalhin mo yung kanyon mo, lahat. that does not really bother me. but, the military and the police will not allow it and i won’t run roughshod with them if i insist it my way. they will obey but they would take it as a bad indication of what’s in my mind. huwag na lang natin guluhin. i will call him masama ang linya pag araw sa jolo eh. so, i’ll call him tonight and just tell him, i’ll fetch you if you want. ako na mismo ang pupunta ng jolo. tapos dalhin kita sa davao at doon tayo mag usap.so parang okay na. but there are two sectors sa mindanao, hindi ko talaga kayang ang unang una because i do not want to talk to the abu sayyaf. masyado silang brutal but outright criminals na walang compassion about human rights. last time na yung bata 17 years old. sabi ko sa kanya, you know, we used to be friends, but nawalan ako ng bilib sa inyo. pati yung ganon, mga bata ma kidnap, masyado namang sumobra kayo sa arte.and if they’re just there to show to us how the isis really works that way, well remember that it takes two to tango. and what you can do, i can do better ten times. i can even eat you alive. bigyan mo lang ako asin at suka, kikilawin talaga kita.i mean, what’s the point of killing? so itong isa are the scholars and the militants. they are now called militants. wala na yung mga maute, there’s the maute group in central mindanao and lanao, at iba pa.so, nag usap kami minsan. you know my lola is a maranao, ang lolo ko chinese. but my father is a visaya, cebu. but i’ve never lived in cebu but if you ask me my lineage, i’d tell you that i am a bisaya. because we take our ancestry from, we count it from the father.wala hindi ako but i can talk to them. before the elections, i, nautusan ko yung and my son, the vice mayor, married a tausug lady and a maranao mother, tatay niya tausug. i kind of go in out in the territories of mindanao. both on the moro land and yung sa ideological borders ng npa pati gobyerno. nakausap ko but this is the one that sabi ko sa kanila, bakit? what’s the use of–? they are the militants that you can talk to. ito yung mga tabligh, yung mahaba yung ano, tapos nakaputi. they’re equivalent to the knights of columbus, christians. yun yun sila. parang ganon.sabi nila, mayor, for as long as the americans are here, we will talk to you, but we will never negotiate for peace. sabi ko na ano, bakit ganon, tagal na to eh. and i remembered sa anc, si lozada, si tatad, si orly, those who pretend to know all. sinabi sa akin na, sabihin mo kay mayor, 100 years na yun. precisely. t*** i**. tinanong ko sa kanila yun: why can’t we just forget this?ngayon, it cannot, sabi ko, it’s in the past. hindi ginamit ko yung sa 100 years. sabi ko, it’s in the past. really past it’s present perfect. tapos yung mga pictures ng massacre, tinambak nila doon sa mga butas butas, eh nandon lahat. yung katorpehan ng amerikano, sila ang kumuha non. and the philippine must got it from the archives of the american. hindi man nila sinunog. maybe that’s part of history of the us.kanila yun. ngayon, medyo sabi ni by these statements that i will not, we will not negotiate with you because we see the americans, mga special forces nasa kampo ng mga natin, sa gobyerno. hindi naman ano nakikita naman. di sabi ko na, there will be a time when we have to talk to the americans to leave mindanao. i never said philippines. siguro niya which is really true, problems in this country, this is our, this used to be our place, and we can’t even talk freely without extensively offending the–you know, when i was mayor, i know that drugs was really a serious problem. piskal ako eh. nakita ko yung mga kaso na dinismiss , walang witness, dumating sa akin tawas, tapos nagsisinungaling yung pulis kung ano anong kalokohan. and even taking pictures of the wives and children coming out of school and from the malls. and even once, kidnapping a teacher who was a wife of the policemen assigned sa narcom ang ano no’n, narcom section or unit ng pcinp. so yung mga ganon, mga atrocities alam ko yan. so when i became mayor i said: leave my city. i cannot work with you around. i cannot improve the environment. we cannot progress if you are around kidnapping people, raping women, selling drug, and crime is everywhere. if you do not leave my city, i will kill you.sabi naman ni ano, stop ni gordon doon sa kanina. stop making noise. no, i cannot stop. because i would lose the momentum i cannot afford it because i am now the president. the momentum has to be there and it will be there for six years until the last pusher is taken out of this place.i cannot, i cannot just play silent. tapos sabihin nila, that got you into trouble. who’s s*** it is? mine? this is my country. there is no law until now presidente na ako, and i said papatayin ko kayo lahat. there is no law at all which says i cannot threaten criminals, either as mayor or president. or if you, if there is anyone who disagrees, give me the provision of law.huwag ka matakot, sabihin mo: p***** i** mo, papatayin kita. sinisira mo yung mga bata because if i do not interdict. alam naman ninyo, you’re all mayor and just count a few years, if i do not interdict this problem now, i should, i will have to compromise the next generation.ang tatama nito ito yung mga high school. but eventually, we will all die, we’ll get old at with three million flies all over the country. they are not concentrated in pandacan or tondo. they’re everywhere. and so with three million, hindi ko binilang yung akin eh. hinayaan ko muna. that was the report of santiago three years ago when he was the head of the pdea. hindi ko sinali yung akin. because ang akin is still evolving nga.by the end of the year, it’s going to hit to another million. everyday may nagsu surrender, hanggang ngayon eh. and 700 was the last clear count, the newspaper stopped. yung abs lang sige na ito, according to the analysis, investigative, sige pagdating ng panahon if it will fail, maligaya kayong lahat diyan. but i have no intentions of failing.and they said that my mouth is, is not a statesman. whoever told you i was, i’m applying to be a statesman? ang pagkaalam ko tumakbo ako ng presidente, ordinaryo lang ako na tao. ako’y simple lang ho na mayor. dumating dito sa, hindi ko nga ma– sa totoo lang, just to illustrate to you how destiny plays us. sino sa inyo ang nag suporta sa akin? ilan lang? 4, 5, 6? wala akong barangay captain, wala akong congressman, wala akong pera. si imee pa ang nagbigay. sabi niya inutang daw niya. si imee supported me.i do not know if because you know my father was a cabinet member of president marcos during the first term of his presidency. my father was one of the two who stood by marcos in his darkest hours. everybody was shifting to the liberal at that time, kay diosdado macapagal. and it was only ebarle and my father who stood by marcos.that is why when he won, my father was one of the cabinet members of marcos. so yan ang ano namin. i cannot really disassociate and besides, may si inday, yung mga curfew, taga paoay. may anak na ako na ilocano. mahirap ng maka ano eh siyempre dugo na yan eh. so may connect na talaga, blood is blood. so yan ang balik tayo dito sa droga, alam ninyo alam ninyo pag hindi ninyo ito nahinto, sabi ko, tingnan mo ang crime, it has dropped 50 percent. hindi nga? bakit wala akong narinig kahapon may ni rape na bata, pinatay ang tatay. wala ng kriminal.so what fueled the criminals to commit the crime? drugs. tingnan mo tahimik na. pati sa dewey boulevard maglakad ka, walang, nobody’s messing up with you.pero sandali lang yan. kaya pag hindi ganon yan eh. parang ano yan. pag huminto ka diyan, humina ka balik na naman yan. because of money. kaya yung mga mayors diyan. i’m not really referring to you ha. pero totoo ito, si yung odicta, the drug lord itong si albuera.sa totoo lang, naunahan niya ako. talagang order ko sa kanya, patayin mo. as in patayin mo. may isa akong team na, sa army, sabi ko, patayin ninyo, wherever he is. sa harap ng simbahan, patayin mo, lalo na sa cemetery. kasi mas malapit na lang itulak mo na ang p**** i** niya.eh kasi man mayor ka, tapos ganon ang ginagawa mo. and you know why? because early on, tinitingnan ko na ang statistics, when i’m the president, i was given everything. notice that bohol is a very a passive place. ang bohol, ayaw ng gulo yan. saan ka nakakita dito ng army taga bohol?ang contribution ng bohol, i’m not trying to be sarcastic about or being funny. ang bohol, naka contribute yan ng– mga taga bohol dito, either pari or madre. yan ang sakit ng mga taga bohol pati yung, for a lesser extent, mga ilokano. conservative eh.karamihan yan mga pari, bohol. ang problema kung bakla rin ang g***. sabi ko, sa bohol bakit maraming droga? ang nagtataka ako kasi yung mga turista nandoon pupunta, both domestic and– nagpupuntahan doon so prevailing ang shabu. saan ito galing? yun pala ang zeroed in kay odicta. he was the number one pati yung, pati yung iloilo, karamihan ng mayor diyan. ah sabi ko sorry na lang. alam mo, bastang order ko pag wala na yung chief of police mo, yan ang utusan ko patayin mo yang p***** i***** mayor mo.pagdating sa ganun i will do it. i will do it. believe me, i will do it. wala akong ano. sabi ko nga, i was saking my honor, my life and the presidency itself. ako, ma impeach? wala naman akong gasto so iniwan ko yung p na yang buhay ko, matrabaho yan wala pang kaya sige ito ang kandidato naming sa presidential eh g*** ka. kung gusto mo mag mayor g*** ka, ah mag presidente. gawain ka na lang clerk araw araw.pag uwi ko ngayon, i have two other functions, pag uwi ko yung folders na yan, department of affairs, justice department, kay yasay, sa dict, sa education, and i have to review it page per page and i have to place marginal notes. hindi ka naman g*** mag marginal notes, mapareho kayo kay arroyo, nag marginal na corruption na tuloy. hindi ba yung sabi ko okay.ano ba naman yung sabi mong okay pagka may pirma na yung mga ano diyan, o pirma anong section? from what department? okay. basahin mo muna.alam mo sa totoo lang, matulog ako pinakamadalas, alas tres, alas quatro, alas singko. tapos kapag ala una, gisingin ako ng ito sila, sir, bihis na sir, may..’ yan. ngayon kung gusto mo mag mayor, eh di tawagin mo yung iba, department secretary mo para mapagperahan. eh ano lang gusto mo, presidente magkapera?kaya ako pagka ano, uwi ako sa dilim, barge eh. si presidente aquino hindi man nagba barge doon umiikot siya. alam siguro niyang butasan yung barge niya dati. eh ako madali eh. three minutes nandoon ka na kesa iikot doon sa o pagdating doon ako lang mag isa. wala man akong asawa, nandoon man sa davao. wala naman rin magsama sa akin, magligaw ako, wala man magsagot sa akin,

pag ano pag kasi ako parinig ako ng parinig ng china. kasi ano bang gusto ninyo. there is the arbitral judgment that we are entitled to the entitlements. it’s not a territorial thing. twelve miles lang yan eh, that’s it. yung 200 miles parang fish pond yan o. philippines ito yung fish pond mo. kanya kanya tayong fish pond. itong pinagawayan dito yung fish pond yung mga tilapia sa loob pati kung may oil diyan. it’s not territorial. so we won, right. but what do you want?there are two ways of doing it. you seize it forcefully or we talk. mamili kayo diyan eh kung gusto niyo ng giyera okay lang man. ang problema manalo ba tayo and where will be the battleground?sa beijing? sa xiamen? palawan? kung maagaw pa ang palawan naloko na. sabihin mo ang china america maniwala ka diyan sa amerikano. they will not fight to die for us. wala tayong nahita tanong niyo yung mga military, ayan man yan sila. yung war games war games. tanungin mo yan silang military. sila lang ang natututo diyan using our soldiers because yung equipment nila pati yung equipment natin there is no compability.hindi magkasya. so ipahiram lang nila during the wargames. hindi compatible yan pagkatapos kunin nila. ganyan man ang amerikano. magtanong kayo ng wala naman tayo makuha diyan sa kanila. sabi ko, until now, sabi ko may isa pa ditong smart aleck, kasi meron man tang f50 made in south korea, correct but are they really made in america. components lang e it was there, it was assembled there kasi doon ginamit outsourcing pareho ng adidas.makina makina lang yang gastos nila doon. mahal yan pero pag ini ship nila the actual assembly nandoon sa korea. made in america yan. that’s american technology. tignan mo nagbili tayo ng dalawa. gusto natin bumili ng mga missile yung and even the 50 caliber mechanism ayaw nilang ibigay. hindi man sa totoo sa amerikano. buhusan ko ng tubig yung mga i will pour water if he lies to me. kaya ako gaano man ako kaya ako nawalan ako ng bilib sa mga g*** na yan. hindi ako bilib sa kanila kaya sabi ko, dito niyo ako dinadaan sa human rights.you cannot stop me. it is my sacred duty although it may sound a s*** to you. it is my sacred duty to keep the integrity of this republic and the people healthy because yang shabu na yan po, mabuti kayo mga mayaman man kayo. you can always pay for the rehab. ang rehab is always a social and health issue. kasi bayaranan yan sa ospital, medisina. social issue. a law and order issue. a health issue.kaya kayong mga amerikano wag kayong ano. ewan ko ang pilipinong ordinaryo pero ako malayo na ako sa inyo. ayaw niyong pabili ng ano armas punta ako sa russia. pinapunta ko yung mga general sa russia. sabi ng mga russian, kasi wala man tayong mga armas eh. you have everything you need, we will give it to you. eh bakit ako maghintay diyan sa ang china naman, sabi punta ka lang dito. mag pirma ka lang dadating lahat yan. oo totoo. tignan mo. sama tayo lahat para ang amerikano magpakain yan ng ano, usap kayo, tubig, juice. china ano pa lang yan, snacks pa lang yan lauriat na yan. . they’re so generous even with food. ako nawalan na ako ng ano sa kanila,nawalan ako ng respeto sa amerikano. nawalan ako ng respeto sa instead of helping us knowing fully well that alam nila because they have a government similar as ours.alam nila na yung bottoms up na bottoms up talaga yun. so sabihin niya halimbawa, easily said than done. where do i get the money? so i’ll get the money from all departments give it to this head department pati yung education pati kay yasay kunin ko from tugade just to build the rehab? so it’s just like robbing peter to pay paul.alam nila yan may gobyerno man sila. instead of helping us, ang unang tumira itong state department so you can go to hell. mr. obama you can go to hell. eu, better choose purgatory. puno na sa impyerno. bakit ako matakot sa inyo? pati tuloy yung nadala. because kasi sabi nila, mga taong munisipyo. t***** tapos naka plunging neckline. ang sunod kasi sasabihin niya, tignan mo may magbulong usually yan dilg ”sir”, yung representante ng dilg magbulong man yan. “sir, si ano yan yung mistress ni ano. kaya kung makita ko yung kalaban, masaydo namang immoral ang set up niyo dito. patayin mo yang babaeng yan. kabit lang pala yang p***, pameyor mayor. pagdating ko sabi yung misis maghatid man sya.. ma’am alis na kami ho. ma’am pag nabiyuda ka ma’am paalamin mo ako, ha? ganyan man ang laro ng buhay.well, anyway i still have three events to go. i’m happy that i met you. at least i have expressed my anger at bakit ganito and the way that i behave because i do not for the life of me i will never mas mabuti pa magluhod ako sa mga king of brunei o thailand. huwag mo akong paluhurin sa amerikano. never, ayoko talaga. you can do your worst actually. basta ako nakapusta diyan: my job, my life and the presidency itself.\n",
      "eh kung hanggang tatlong taon lang ako, so be it. eh, destiny yan eh . andiyan na yan hindi mo na pagka iyan ang landing mo talaga. sino diyan makaabot ng presidente. but pag sabihin o, paabot ka diyan, dito ka lang, mahirap. so di hanggang diyan na tayo but remember, ako ang sinabi ko ito sa military, para malaman ninyo pati sa pulis. wala doon galing ako sa wounded personnel diyan sa bonifacio.sabi ko sa kanila if i do not last long, eh i travel nga ng umuwi uwi ako doon. commercial, maski ano na lang. maski anong eroplano maski mag spray ng spray basta pumunta ng davao sakyan ko yan. basta makauwi lang. pero if i do not make it sa aking presidency or if the problem would outlast me, remember na mahirap itong laban na ito because narco politics has set in.the reason why i do not want an election because money, narco money will be used to finance the candidacies of so many candidates diyan at kapag yan ang nanalo whether you like it or not, he wields power he will use it.and yung sanay na na maraming pera, hindi na aatras yan. kapag hindi kayo nagbantay, you will be facing a candidate backed by narco politics, lots of money.one thing is really asked of you except you just ako na ang bahala. pag sinabi ko sa pulis hirit kayo, just do your duty. i said arrest them and overcome the resistance but if you find yourself in danger of losing your life, shoot them. that has always been my order.now, ako, there is no law at all which says that a mayor or a governor cannot threaten criminals. what kind of law is that na takutin mo criminal ikaw pa makulong? g**** batas yan. ngayon, what is my guarantee to the police? saan ko man ito, sige ako basa. kalaban mo ombudsman mayroon pang human rights, ang pulis mayroon pang rd’s office yung regional command paimebestigahin ka.eureka, pardon. go do your duty in accordance with my order, lawfully. makapatay ka, idemanda ka. pagdating ng subpoena ibalik mo sa akin. fill up your name there. please sign diyan. pardon. abogado man tayo. it does not even say you are allowed to pardon 5 persons or 10 persons.the president can grant pardon absolute or conditional or may grant amnesty with the concurrence of congress, period! o sige, kulungin mo. pardon lahat yan. sabi ko, huwag kayo magtakot. ako ang bahala nga eh. sige, fight kayo yang pulis. ngayon bakit ang pulis ngayon kasi hindi na natatakot. i tell you iyang mga yan may droga paranoid yan may mga armas yan.invariably they carry because the first thing that afflicts them is paranoia. sige yan sila tingin ganoon na may humahabol sa kanila. kita mo sa nahuli sa mga pulis para siyang hinahabol ng demonyo na magdala talaga ng armas yan. kaya bakit ngayon? because ngayon nagtatrabaho ang pulis. noon kasi takot pag na suspend at that day wala nang sweldo, wala nang pagkain ang pamilya. now what do i do? what was i doing in davao? pagka na suspend ang pulis ako ang magbigay ng suweldo sa intelligence fund.i provide a lawyer, take home pay niya binibigay ko at saka yung pamilya niya sigurado may sweldo siya maski suspended kaya ang pulis sa davao pag sinabi ko magtrabaho, nagtrabaho.kita mo ngayon, ang nagdala taga davao. kung ano yung style ng police, ganoon ang style ni duterte. you just follow him and you’re safe. oo, kasi kung hindi ko ganunin hindi magtrabaho yung pulis. pagdating niyang human rights kawawa ang pulis. pagdating ng congress doon huwag kayong magtakot. kung ayaw niyong magsalita sabihin niyo, sir wala akong tinatamad kaming magsalita. kung gusto ninyo sabihin niyo lang. pagod ako sir ayokong magsalita tapos.para hindi ka na mapilit ng congressman. your honor i would like to invoke the right to remain silent. period. wala nang congressman, walang senador, walang makatanong sa iyo. if you use that and nothing can be inferred against you hindi ka yan ”silence means consent” is not applicable in the constitution. o sabihin mo ayaw mong magsalita you cannot infer that because there is no adverse inference that you can make if a person invokes the right to remain silent. constitution yan eh.yun naman ang laban mo. shut up ka. pagdating ng human rights, sabiohin mo, ayoko. pagdating ng ombudsman, ewan ko. pagdating ng congress, ah ewan ko. tinatamad kaming magsalita eh di period. i am invoking the right to remain silent sir. i will not talk, wala na. wala nang iba diyan. dismissed na ibig sabihin uwi na tayo. ayan naman si, andyan si ed oh.ito yung panahon namin ito yung pinakagwapo sa san beda. naka nakatatlo ito. sa centro escolar siguro kapitbahay man nakadalawa sa holy spirit isa. mga mayor, gobernador maraming salamat po at if there’s anything that i can do for you sabi ko i am not into politics anymore. kita ko wala akong, i do not travel to because walang ano, one shot lang naman ako. i will never come back this way again so i would just assure that we work together. i’m sounding off the alarm regarding drugs. please do something about it.ngayon kung sabihin ninyo hindi niyo kaya, huwag kayo maghiya sabihin niyo mayor, hindi ko ugali yang bayolenteng pamamaraan, ah sige tumabi ka lang diyan. ako na mismo. marami bang magaganda doon sa inyo?

      "salamat po. kindly sit down. i dispense with the acknowledgements. may i address everybody, my co workers in government, ladies and gentlemen.\n",
      "alam natin ho lahat ang problema sa pilipinas and in my generation, ito ang pinaka mabigat. i’m about i’m on the sunset days of my life. i am politically dead after this term. i’ve nowhere to go but to retire and perhaps in the fullness of god’s time, i die early so that i can rest.\n",
      "ganito yan eh. i’d like to just give you a resumé of myself para you’d know where i come from. before i became mayor, i was a prosecutor in davao city. i was doing trial work for almost eight years and i became an oic vice mayor, eventually to run in 1988 elections. therefrom, hindi naman ako nag ano but i’ve been there for 23 years as mayor, congressman, and vice mayor to my daughter, inday. all throughout, it would be something like 40 years in the government service.\n",
      " nong piskal ho ako and because that was near, about the time shabu was making its entrance in the social scene. marami ho akong kaso na na dismiss because at that time katatapos lang ng martial law because of the cory administration.\n",
      "may mga kaso siguro akong, about 32 of them i remember, talagang bumagsak. because at that time, there was only one forensic analyst, a chemical engineer actually, assigned sa, itong forensics ngayon. and he had to take care about so many provinces under region 11. so at one time, cases were torn, but all the time he’s never there for the simple reason that he has to be in this province. ang subpoeana nauna and he cannot travel alone at that time except to wait for a convoy, either of the police or the philippine constabulary at that time before getting to travel.\n",
      "kasi pag natyambahan ka ng npa noon, either the buses are stopped suddenly, there’s a checkpoint and if you are there, goodbye. noon talagang pag nahuli ka, wala na yan. and i know that because i used to talk them and hinihingi ko minsan ang balato yung iba, but still lalo na pag ka even now. good that we have this moratorium, a respite of the fighting. yung, paksabi na–alam ninyo kayong may contact sa npa. pag ka intelligence officer yan, diretso yan. wala ng hindi mo na if you ask them, they would say wag na lang yan mayor, tapos na. basta intelligence officer, diretso yan, diretso na yan.\n",
      "he attempted na lumaban nang husto kasi ganon ang even right before the ceasefire. nong nag ceasefire tayo, i declared one earlier to show good faith on the part of the government. inambush naman ng buwang yung mga sundalo sa surigao banda, kaya ako nagalit. then nag away kami ni sison, professor, kilala kami. nagmurahan kami. sabi ko, ikaw nagpakita na nga ako ng magandang loob eh. but eventually they are now in oslo talking about peace.\n",
      "so marami akong bakante na sundalo at nai deploy ko sa mindanao. because doon sa jolo, we are battling it out with them.\n",
      "ganito yan eh. i am not a wartime president. i was elected in an environment where democracy was being played out. i am a president that would seek peace for my land.\n",
      "wala akong ambisyon na ipagpatuloy itong lahat na giyera because it could not only suck the human filipino spirit but everybody, lahat ng hatred would continue and continue and continue.\n",
      "nakipag usap ako sa npa, ndf sila, okay na tayo. i talked to murad, i talked to jaafar and yung central committee, i got a response, positive. despite the fact that murad earlier said that we’ll go to war if there is no bbl.\n",
      "sabi ko sir, ipag ano mo na muna, sabi ko sayang ang buhay, sayang talaga. and si nur naman, i just talked to him coming over here, and kung sinong kung kilala ni nur, the line was very bad, but i heard him saying that he’s going to go to me in davao but has to bring his troops as security.\n",
      "i could not explain to him that that could not be possible anymore. unang una, he is facing charges and if at all, he’s allowed to go out, lalo na hindi siya pwede magdala ng sarili niyang armas. ako, wala akong ano diyan eh. maski dalhin mo yung kanyon mo, lahat. that does not really bother me. but, the military and the police will not allow it and i won’t run roughshod with them if i insist it my way. they will obey but they would take it as a bad indication of what’s in my mind. huwag na lang natin guluhin. i will call him masama ang linya pag araw sa jolo eh. so, i’ll call him tonight and just tell him, i’ll fetch you if you want. ako na mismo ang pupunta ng jolo. tapos dalhin kita sa davao at doon tayo mag usap.\n",
      "so parang okay na. but there are two sectors sa mindanao, hindi ko talaga kayang ang unang una because i do not want to talk to the abu sayyaf. masyado silang brutal but outright criminals na walang compassion about human rights. last time na yung bata 17 years old. sabi ko sa kanya, you know, we used to be friends, but nawalan ako ng bilib sa inyo. pati yung ganon, mga bata ma kidnap, masyado namang sumobra kayo sa arte.\n",
      "and if they’re just there to show to us how the isis really works that way, well remember that it takes two to tango. and what you can do, i can do better ten times. i can even eat you alive. bigyan mo lang ako asin at suka, kikilawin talaga kita.\n",
      "i mean, what’s the point of killing? so itong isa are the scholars and the militants. they are now called militants. wala na yung mga maute, there’s the maute group in central mindanao and lanao, at iba pa.\n",
      "so, nag usap kami minsan. you know my lola is a maranao, ang lolo ko chinese. but my father is a visaya, cebu. but i’ve never lived in cebu but if you ask me my lineage, i’d tell you that i am a bisaya. because we take our ancestry from, we count it from the father.\n",
      "wala hindi ako but i can talk to them. before the elections, i, nautusan ko yung and my son, the vice mayor, married a tausug lady and a maranao mother, tatay niya tausug. i kind of go in out in the territories of mindanao. both on the moro land and yung sa ideological borders ng npa pati gobyerno. nakausap ko but this is the one that sabi ko sa kanila, bakit? what’s the use of–? they are the militants that you can talk to. ito yung mga tabligh, yung mahaba yung ano, tapos nakaputi. they’re equivalent to the knights of columbus, christians. yun yun sila. parang ganon.\n",
      "sabi nila, mayor, for as long as the americans are here, we will talk to you, but we will never negotiate for peace. sabi ko na ano, bakit ganon, tagal na to eh. and i remembered sa anc, si lozada, si tatad, si orly, those who pretend to know all. sinabi sa akin na, sabihin mo kay mayor, 100 years na yun. precisely. t*** i**. tinanong ko sa kanila yun: why can’t we just forget this?\n",
      "ngayon, it cannot, sabi ko, it’s in the past. hindi ginamit ko yung sa 100 years. sabi ko, it’s in the past. really past it’s present perfect. tapos yung mga pictures ng massacre, tinambak nila doon sa mga butas butas, eh nandon lahat. yung katorpehan ng amerikano, sila ang kumuha non. and the philippine must got it from the archives of the american. hindi man nila sinunog. maybe that’s part of history of the us.\n",
      "kanila yun. ngayon, medyo sabi ni by these statements that i will not, we will not negotiate with you because we see the americans, mga special forces nasa kampo ng mga natin, sa gobyerno. hindi naman ano nakikita naman. di sabi ko na, there will be a time when we have to talk to the americans to leave mindanao. i never said philippines. siguro niya which is really true, problems in this country, this is our, this used to be our place, and we can’t even talk freely without extensively offending the–\n",
      "you know, when i was mayor, i know that drugs was really a serious problem. piskal ako eh. nakita ko yung mga kaso na dinismiss , walang witness, dumating sa akin tawas, tapos nagsisinungaling yung pulis kung ano anong kalokohan. and even taking pictures of the wives and children coming out of school and from the malls. and even once, kidnapping a teacher who was a wife of the policemen assigned sa narcom ang ano no’n, narcom section or unit ng pcinp. so yung mga ganon, mga atrocities alam ko yan. so when i became mayor i said: leave my city. i cannot work with you around. i cannot improve the environment. we cannot progress if you are around kidnapping people, raping women, selling drug, and crime is everywhere. if you do not leave my city, i will kill you.\n",
      "sabi naman ni ano, stop ni gordon doon sa kanina. stop making noise. no, i cannot stop. because i would lose the momentum i cannot afford it because i am now the president. the momentum has to be there and it will be there for six years until the last pusher is taken out of this place.\n",
      "i cannot, i cannot just play silent. tapos sabihin nila, that got you into trouble. who’s s*** it is? mine? this is my country. there is no law until now presidente na ako, and i said papatayin ko kayo lahat. there is no law at all which says i cannot threaten criminals, either as mayor or president. or if you, if there is anyone who disagrees, give me the provision of law.\n",
      "huwag ka matakot, sabihin mo: p***** i** mo, papatayin kita. sinisira mo yung mga bata because if i do not interdict. alam naman ninyo, you’re all mayor and just count a few years, if i do not interdict this problem now, i should, i will have to compromise the next generation.\n",
      "ang tatama nito ito yung mga high school. but eventually, we will all die, we’ll get old at with three million flies all over the country. they are not concentrated in pandacan or tondo. they’re everywhere. and so with three million, hindi ko binilang yung akin eh. hinayaan ko muna. that was the report of santiago three years ago when he was the head of the pdea. hindi ko sinali yung akin. because ang akin is still evolving nga.\n",
      "by the end of the year, it’s going to hit to another million. everyday may nagsu surrender, hanggang ngayon eh. and 700 was the last clear count, the newspaper stopped. yung abs lang sige na ito, according to the analysis, investigative, sige pagdating ng panahon if it will fail, maligaya kayong lahat diyan. but i have no intentions of failing.\n",
      "and they said that my mouth is, is not a statesman. whoever told you i was, i’m applying to be a statesman? ang pagkaalam ko tumakbo ako ng presidente, ordinaryo lang ako na tao. ako’y simple lang ho na mayor. dumating dito sa, hindi ko nga ma– sa totoo lang, just to illustrate to you how destiny plays us. sino sa inyo ang nag suporta sa akin? ilan lang? 4, 5, 6? wala akong barangay captain, wala akong congressman, wala akong pera. si imee pa ang nagbigay. sabi niya inutang daw niya. si imee supported me.\n",
      "i do not know if because you know my father was a cabinet member of president marcos during the first term of his presidency. my father was one of the two who stood by marcos in his darkest hours. everybody was shifting to the liberal at that time, kay diosdado macapagal. and it was only ebarle and my father who stood by marcos.\n",
      "that is why when he won, my father was one of the cabinet members of marcos. so yan ang ano namin. i cannot really disassociate and besides, may si inday, yung mga curfew, taga paoay. may anak na ako na ilocano. mahirap ng maka ano eh siyempre dugo na yan eh. so may connect na talaga, blood is blood. so yan ang \n",
      "balik tayo dito sa droga, alam ninyo alam ninyo pag hindi ninyo ito nahinto, sabi ko, tingnan mo ang crime, it has dropped 50 percent. hindi nga? bakit wala akong narinig kahapon may ni rape na bata, pinatay ang tatay. wala ng kriminal.\n",
      "so what fueled the criminals to commit the crime? drugs. tingnan mo tahimik na. pati sa dewey boulevard maglakad ka, walang, nobody’s messing up with you.\n",
      "pero sandali lang yan. kaya pag hindi ganon yan eh. parang ano yan. pag huminto ka diyan, humina ka balik na naman yan. because of money. kaya yung mga mayors diyan. i’m not really referring to you ha. pero totoo ito, si yung odicta, the drug lord itong si albuera.\n",
      "sa totoo lang, naunahan niya ako. talagang order ko sa kanya, patayin mo. as in patayin mo. may isa akong team na, sa army, sabi ko, patayin ninyo, wherever he is. sa harap ng simbahan, patayin mo, lalo na sa cemetery. kasi mas malapit na lang itulak mo na ang p**** i** niya.\n",
      "eh kasi man mayor ka, tapos ganon ang ginagawa mo. and you know why? because early on, tinitingnan ko na ang statistics, when i’m the president, i was given everything. notice that bohol is a very a passive place. ang bohol, ayaw ng gulo yan. saan ka nakakita dito ng army taga bohol?\n",
      "ang contribution ng bohol, i’m not trying to be sarcastic about or being funny. ang bohol, naka contribute yan ng– mga taga bohol dito, either pari or madre. yan ang sakit ng mga taga bohol pati yung, for a lesser extent, mga ilokano. conservative eh.\n",
      "karamihan yan mga pari, bohol. ang problema kung bakla rin ang g***. sabi ko, sa bohol bakit maraming droga? ang nagtataka ako kasi yung mga turista nandoon pupunta, both domestic and– nagpupuntahan doon so prevailing ang shabu. saan ito galing?\n",
      " yun pala ang zeroed in kay odicta. he was the number one pati yung, pati yung iloilo, karamihan ng mayor diyan. ah sabi ko sorry na lang. alam mo, bastang order ko pag wala na yung chief of police mo, yan ang utusan ko patayin mo yang p***** i***** mayor mo.\n",
      "pagdating sa ganun i will do it. i will do it. believe me, i will do it. wala akong ano. sabi ko nga, i was saking my honor, my life and the presidency itself. ako, ma impeach? wala naman akong gasto so iniwan ko yung p[westo, eh ano? honor? how can i lose honor when i grieve for my country. life? lahat naman tayo namamatay. darating yung panahon, i’ve always believed in destiny.\n",

      "this started, kaibigan ko na yan si nograles, has a political garbage issue sa davao. totoo talagang yumayari ako, pero yung karamihan diyan talagang away yan. sa footage pa ng abs nong bago pa akong mayor. banatan kami doon. talagang, pati yung ginawa ng isyu na mga babae, na yung si pugoy, yung pinatay ko lahat. ang sabi ko, mabuti pa tong mga p**** i*** ito naunahan pa ang mayor, totoo yun sinabi ko yun.\n",
      "but hindi na, out of, para bang inismall ko yung pagkalalaki derogate the manhood. p**** i*** mga g**** kapangit nito nakatikim pa ng totoo yun nasabi ko. but kino compile compile nila pati yung pinatay ko.\n",
      "doon sa davao noon, maldito kasi itong si nograles eh. basta may patay doon, pag walang suspek, maski dito. dito ngayon. pag may nakita diyan nakahapla, extrajudicial killing. p***, extrajudicial. ginamit ni nograles and yet he never won an election, kay inday or sa akin. i have never lost an election actually until naging presidente. noong ano, hindi ito umuubra na davao kasi ang tao nakikita nila. sino ba naman gusto na magulo yan sila? sino ba namang bakit itong ngayon nung election, you would notice that at that particular extrajudicial killing was never an issue against me, not even during the debates but yung ang rating bigla na akong tumaas derecho derecho na. kinarga nito ni trillanes pati yung lahat ng basura. ang inquirer taga pintura din ng basura lahat sila and abs cbn, too kinarga nila lahat yan and i can tell this because i have the records still to show you if you want kaya puwede akong manginsulto ng tao.\n",

      "that is the proper way. well how are they supposed na miyembro tayo tapos ganonin mo ako. kaya ako nagsabi ako, naglaban ako because when you are already at the receiving end of an uncontrollable wrath of whatever ano yan, mababaon ka, the only way out is really, is to insult. that was my retaliation to them. sinabi kong mga p***** i** ninyo. tignan mo talaga itong ngo ng maynila. what is the connotation, the usual connotation sa ating ng son of a b****. others would say, . ang nilagay nila the best of the ”son of a w****”\n",
      "nakita mong is not usually being used but when you judge, you judge the best way you say it people judge best when they condemn so that they use the word. ito namang mga amerikano, napaka bobo naman, alam nila na i am a midterm president that when i entered the presidency, there was already no money. ang naabutan ko mooa lang. towards the end of the year. wala akong capital outlay, kaya wala akong maitulong sa inyo kaya ako nagatago. hindi sabihin na ayaw ko kayong kasi mahirap naman talagang ilambing yan.\n",
      "as of now or next year, o mayroon na tayo so i have more than a trillion to distribute and it will be distributed equally. wala nang pulitika pulitika. i am a gusto ko ilan lang naman ang pagbigyan ko sa pulitika, 1 2 3 nanalo ako sa lanao. eh siyempre, pinsan kong mnlf andun lahat. tingnan mo pagpasok ko ng lanao, p***tanggalin mo nga lahat yan. napaka corny ninyo dito.\n",

      "so, balik tayo sa– ako galit sa kanila. alam mo yung kabastusan ng amerikano? pag ano pag kasi ako parinig ako ng parinig ng china. kasi ano bang gusto ninyo. there is the arbitral judgment that we are entitled to the entitlements. it’s not a territorial thing. twelve miles lang yan eh, that’s it. yung 200 miles parang fish pond yan o. philippines ito yung fish pond mo. kanya kanya tayong fish pond. itong pinagawayan dito yung fish pond yung mga tilapia sa loob pati kung may oil diyan. it’s not territorial. so we won, right. but what do you want? there are two ways of doing it. you seize it forcefully or we talk. mamili kayo diyan eh kung gusto niyo ng giyera okay lang man. ang problema manalo ba tayo and where will be the battleground?\n",
      "sa beijing? sa xiamen? palawan? kung maagaw pa ang palawan naloko na. sabihin mo ang china america maniwala ka diyan sa amerikano. they will not fight to die for us. wala tayong nahita tanong niyo yung mga military, ayan man yan sila. yung war games war games. tanungin mo yan silang military. sila lang ang natututo diyan using our soldiers because yung equipment nila pati yung equipment natin there is no compability.\n",
      "hindi magkasya. so ipahiram lang nila during the wargames. hindi compatible yan pagkatapos kunin nila. ganyan man ang amerikano. magtanong kayo ng wala naman tayo makuha diyan sa kanila. sabi ko, until now, sabi ko may isa pa ditong smart aleck, kasi meron man tang f50 made in south korea, correct but are they really made in america. components lang e it was there, it was assembled there kasi doon ginamit outsourcing pareho ng adidas.\n",
      "makina makina lang yang gastos nila doon. mahal yan pero pag ini ship nila the actual assembly nandoon sa korea. made in america yan. that’s american technology. tignan mo nagbili tayo ng dalawa. gusto natin bumili ng mga missile yung and even the 50 caliber mechanism ayaw nilang ibigay. hindi man sa totoo sa amerikano. buhusan ko ng tubig yung mga i will pour water if he lies to me. kaya ako gaano man ako kaya ako nawalan ako ng bilib sa mga g*** na yan. hindi ako bilib sa kanila kaya sabi ko, dito niyo ako dinadaan sa human rights.\n",
      "you cannot stop me. it is my sacred duty although it may sound a s*** to you. it is my sacred duty to keep the integrity of this republic and the people healthy because yang shabu na yan po, mabuti kayo mga mayaman man kayo. you can always pay for the rehab. ang rehab is always a social and health issue. kasi bayaranan yan sa ospital, medisina. social issue. a law and order issue. a health issue.\n",
      "kaya kayong mga amerikano wag kayong ano. ewan ko ang pilipinong ordinaryo pero ako malayo na ako sa inyo. ayaw niyong pabili ng ano armas punta ako sa russia. pinapunta ko yung mga general sa russia. sabi ng mga russian, kasi wala man tayong mga armas eh. you have everything you need, we will give it to you. eh bakit ako maghintay diyan sa \n",
      "ang china naman, sabi punta ka lang dito. mag pirma ka lang dadating lahat yan. oo totoo. tignan mo. sama tayo lahat para ang amerikano magpakain yan ng ano, usap kayo, tubig, juice. china ano pa lang yan, snacks pa lang yan lauriat na yan. . they’re so generous even with food. ako nawalan na ako ng ano sa kanila,nawalan ako ng respeto sa amerikano. nawalan ako ng respeto sa instead of helping us knowing fully well that alam nila because they have a government similar as ours.\n",
      "alam nila na yung bottoms up na bottoms up talaga yun. so sabihin niya halimbawa, easily said than done. where do i get the money? so i’ll get the money from all departments give it to this head department pati yung education pati kay yasay kunin ko from tugade just to build the rehab? so it’s just like robbing peter to pay paul.\n",
      "alam nila yan may gobyerno man sila. instead of helping us, ang unang tumira itong state department so you can go to hell. mr. obama you can go to hell. eu, better choose purgatory. puno na sa impyerno. bakit ako matakot sa inyo? pati tuloy yung nadala. because kasi sabi nila, “yang si duterte, hitler yan eh. maraming pinatay eh di ako rin. sabagay it was really a faux pas. it was a classic faux pas. o sige si hitler na lang ako. pinatay ni hitler kayo, clear sabi ko, patayin ko ang mga durugista.\n",
      "i was not making any comparison, i was stressing a point there. anyway, i apologize for it and i apologize again. it was not politically, socially, correct of me to say that and if i ruffle the feathers of the jewish community, may i say i’m sorry. it was just part of the mental and sometimes kasi ito ayaw sumunod nito. there were times if you talk too much and tutulong ang connectives ng– nauuna ito.\n",
      "yung iba naman, ito na lang ang serviceable. why is the tongue so valuable? he takes care of your hunger, sexual and food. well, ito lang ang masabi ko sayo kaya ako galit, never mind my mouth, pare pareho man tayo. i never aspired to be a statesman yung– hindi ito ala marcos ha, imee ha.\n",
      " my countrymen,’ wala yun. hoy mga p***** i** ninyo, maski doon sa congress, doon sa oathtaking, pagtingin ko, kayo? wala man kayong nagsuporta ni isa dito eh kanya kanyang panahon eh tao naman. maybe i have yet to show the best of my being. hanggang ngayon wala pa ewan ko baka hindi magdating, sory na lang pero at least dumaan ako ng pagka mayor.\n",
      "ako ho sa totoo lang, nagkmali lang ang panginoong diyos. sa totoo lang. ang ugali ko talaga pang mayor lang. pang mayor lang ako. yung pumalakpak, kasi hindi man sila maging presidente rin talaga. and if i identify myself with them so okay na. this is not a self derogation. i do not want to demean myself pero ang ugali ko talaga pang mayor lang. i am not really for the big league, sabi ko nga eh.\n",
      "sila, si ano kasi itong bata ninyo si roxas, wharton, sino yung wharton? sabi ko, anong wharton, pagtingin ko sa ano watson pala. p***** i** ngayon, galit pa sa akin. kayo siguro gumagastos kayo ng atake ko. kasi ang may galit si– pero ayaw ko nang makipag away. i think i told him sa debate, takot ka lang mamatay kasi mayaman ka. totoo naman. tayo, mamamatay tayo. kayo diyan okay na ba kayo? ako wala pa. sabagay pero good na ako sa buhay ko. good na ako. i am kasi walang pulitika. so everybody can– pag may problema kayo.\n",
      "sabihin ko sa inyo ang totoo, pag may pera pa maghati hati muna tayo, itong naiwan pero ibang probleman ninyo tutulong ako. demanda kayo ng isang asawa mo, nagkaproblema ka dito sa isa o yung asawa mo governor tapos yung girlfriend mo yung mayor, ikaw congressman, marami yan. p**** i*** maniwala kayo, marami yan. anak ng p*** ang qualification to be a mayor, governor, first, must be a filipino citizen, must be 25 or35 years old. must at least be a mistress, a current mistress.\n",
      "yun marami yan dito political contemporary times natin, yan. siya congressman, yung isa mayor yung– kaya maraming mga ano dito ngayon mga mayor, mga governor kagaganda. oo aba maniwala ka sakin umikot ako.\n",
      "may magsabing, mga taong munisipyo. t***** tapos naka plunging neckline. ang sunod kasi sasabihin niya, tignan mo may magbulong usually yan dilg ”sir”, yung representante ng dilg magbulong man yan. “sir, si ano yan yung mistress ni ano. \n",
      "kaya kung makita ko yung kalaban, masaydo namang immoral ang set up niyo dito. patayin mo yang babaeng yan. kabit lang pala yang p***, pameyor mayor. pagdating ko sabi yung misis maghatid man sya.. ma’am alis na kami ho. ma’am pag nabiyuda ka ma’am paalamin mo ako, ha? ganyan man ang laro ng buhay.\n",
      "well, anyway i still have three events to go. i’m happy that i met you. at least i have expressed my anger at bakit ganito and the way that i behave because i do not for the life of me i will never mas mabuti pa magluhod ako sa mga king of brunei o thailand. huwag mo akong paluhurin sa amerikano. never, ayoko talaga. you can do your worst actually. basta ako nakapusta diyan: my job, my life and the presidency itself.\n",
      "eh kung hanggang tatlong taon lang ako, so be it. eh, destiny yan eh . andiyan na yan hindi mo na pagka iyan ang landing mo talaga. sino diyan makaabot ng presidente. but pag sabihin o, paabot ka diyan, dito ka lang, mahirap. so di hanggang diyan na tayo but remember, ako ang sinabi ko ito sa military, para malaman ninyo pati sa pulis. wala doon galing ako sa wounded personnel diyan sa bonifacio.\n",
      "sabi ko sa kanila if i do not last long, eh i travel nga ng umuwi uwi ako doon. commercial, maski ano na lang. maski anong eroplano maski mag spray ng spray basta pumunta ng davao sakyan ko yan. basta makauwi lang. pero if i do not make it sa aking presidency or if the problem would outlast me, remember na mahirap itong laban na ito because narco politics has set in.\n",
      "the reason why i do not want an election because money, narco money will be used to finance the candidacies of so many candidates diyan at kapag yan ang nanalo whether you like it or not, he wields power he will use it. and yung sanay na na maraming pera, hindi na aatras yan. kapag hindi kayo nagbantay, you will be facing a candidate backed by narco politics, lots of money.\n",
      "one thing is really asked of you except you just ako na ang bahala. pag sinabi ko sa pulis hirit kayo, just do your duty. i said arrest them and overcome the resistance but if you find yourself in danger of losing your life, shoot them. that has always been my order.\n",
      "now, ako, there is no law at all which says that a mayor or a governor cannot threaten criminals. what kind of law is that na takutin mo criminal ikaw pa makulong? g**** batas yan. ngayon, what is my guarantee to the police? saan ko man ito, sige ako basa. kalaban mo ombudsman mayroon pang human rights, ang pulis mayroon pang rd’s office yung regional command paimebestigahin ka.\n",
      "eureka, pardon. go do your duty in accordance with my order, lawfully. makapatay ka, idemanda ka. pagdating ng subpoena ibalik mo sa akin. fill up your name there. please sign diyan. pardon. abogado man tayo. it does not even say you are allowed to pardon 5 persons or 10 persons.\n",
      "the president can grant pardon absolute or conditional or may grant amnesty with the concurrence of congress, period! o sige, kulungin mo. pardon lahat yan. sabi ko, huwag kayo magtakot. ako ang bahala nga eh. sige, fight kayo yang pulis. ngayon bakit ang pulis ngayon kasi hindi na natatakot. i tell you iyang mga yan may droga paranoid yan may mga armas yan.\n",
      "invariably they carry because the first thing that afflicts them is paranoia. sige yan sila tingin ganoon na may humahabol sa kanila. kita mo sa nahuli sa mga pulis para siyang hinahabol ng demonyo na magdala talaga ng armas yan. kaya bakit ngayon? because ngayon nagtatrabaho ang pulis. noon kasi takot pag na suspend at that day wala nang sweldo, wala nang pagkain ang pamilya. now what do i do? what was i doing in davao? pagka na suspend ang pulis ako ang magbigay ng suweldo sa intelligence fund.\n",
      "i provide a lawyer, take home pay niya binibigay ko at saka yung pamilya niya sigurado may sweldo siya maski suspended kaya ang pulis sa davao pag sinabi ko magtrabaho, nagtrabaho.\n",
      "kita mo ngayon, ang nagdala taga davao. kung ano yung style ng police, ganoon ang style ni duterte. you just follow him and you’re safe. oo, kasi kung hindi ko ganunin hindi magtrabaho yung pulis. pagdating niyang human rights kawawa ang pulis. pagdating ng congress doon huwag kayong magtakot. kung ayaw niyong magsalita sabihin niyo, sir wala akong tinatamad kaming magsalita. kung gusto ninyo sabihin niyo lang. pagod ako sir ayokong magsalita tapos.\n",
      "para hindi ka na mapilit ng congressman. your honor i would like to invoke the right to remain silent. period. wala nang congressman, walang senador, walang makatanong sa iyo. if you use that and nothing can be inferred against you hindi ka yan ”silence means consent” is not applicable in the constitution. o sabihin mo ayaw mong magsalita you cannot infer that because there is no adverse inference that you can make if a person invokes the right to remain silent. constitution yan eh.\n",
      "yun naman ang laban mo. shut up ka. pagdating ng human rights, sabiohin mo, ayoko. pagdating ng ombudsman, ewan ko. pagdating ng congress, ah ewan ko. tinatamad kaming magsalita eh di period. i am invoking the right to remain silent sir. i will not talk, wala na. wala nang iba diyan. dismissed na ibig sabihin uwi na tayo. ayan naman si, andyan si ed oh.\n",
      "ito yung panahon namin ito yung pinakagwapo sa san beda. naka nakatatlo ito. sa centro escolar siguro kapitbahay man nakadalawa sa holy spirit isa. mga mayor, gobernador maraming salamat po at if there’s anything that i can do for you sabi ko i am not into politics anymore. kita ko wala akong, i do not travel to because walang ano, one shot lang naman ako. i will never come back this way again so i would just assure that we work together. i’m sounding off the alarm regarding drugs. please do something about it.\n",
      "ngayon kung sabihin ninyo hindi niyo kaya, huwag kayo maghiya sabihin niyo mayor, hindi ko ugali yang bayolenteng pamamaraan, ah sige tumabi ka lang diyan. ako na mismo. marami bang magaganda doon sa inyo? para makades no, no, no, i will do it for you. ako i do not want to interfere. i do not want to yung may naiwan diyan, wala na i think what i would just do is to send it to the supreme court or the judges and send it to the police yung kanila.\n",
      "kasi the i create so many whirlwinds. pag ano eh magulo masyado. it’s not only one. marami yan eh, barangay captain pati pulis. pero itong mga pulis p******* i*** kayo oh sinabi ko sa inyo huwag niyo akong lokohin. mauunat talaga kayo. sa davao lahat ng pulis pumasok sa droga pinatay ko talaga. lahat ng nagkidnap pinatay ko leche kayo. sabi ni duterte doon sa ano p****** i** istorya man lang yan naniwala naman kayo.\n"

       "'your excellency prime minister shinzo abe and madam abe, distinguished members of the japanese delegation, fellow workers in government, friends, ladies and gentlemen.tonight is a welcome and a much awaited reunion. just four months ago, i was in tokyo discussing in earnest with prime minister abe ways to define the strong and strategic partnership between the philippines and japan.by all accounts, that visit was a success, with both sides agreeing to chart a common path towards a deeper and even more meaningful engagement.prime minister abe’s presence in manila today is proof positive that japan and the philippines are fully committed to bring this long standing friendship and tried and tested partnership to even greater heights.our discussions earlier today moved us to a new level, closer to the achievement of common goals of ensuring a stable and more secure environment for our nations and our peoples to continue to grow.we resolved to strengthen maritime and security cooperation, advance the cause of peace and development in mindanao, intensify economic and trade cooperation, and to address the scourge of the illegal drugs trade in a comprehensive manner.the agreements we signed today show that on all fronts, we are moving forward together as only true friends can. we are friends who treat each other with mutual respect and trust. we are friends who are bound by a shared common resolve to uphold democracy, adherence to the rule of law and a peaceful settlement of disputes.and we are friends who constantly seek to invigorate relations through cooperation. indeed, allow me to say again tonight that ours is a special friendship whose value is beyond any measure. as countries and peoples that have a shared and meaningful history, we can look forward with confidence to a brighter future filled with ever expanding opportunities for working together.tomorrow, prime minister abe will visit davao city. as a son of mindanao and former mayor of davao, i welcome this sincere gesture. his visits to manila and davao are record setting and a highlight of genuine desire to connect with the filipino people. prime minister abe is the first head of government to visit the philippines in 2017 and during my first term. and he will be also the first leader that i will welcome in davao city during my presidency.in tokyo, i said that japan deserves its own rightful place in the constellation of the philippines’ friends. tonight, let me reiterate that japan is a friend closer than a brother. that means that japan is a friend unlike any other.on this note, i therefore ask everyone to raise their glasses.to their majesties, the emperor and empress, for their continued good health and benevolent reign.to his excellency, prime minister shinzo abe and his wife, for your strong and wise leadership.to the people of japan for your generosity and prosperity.mabuhay! presidential communications office\\npresidential news desktoast remarks\\nof\\njapanese prime minister shinzo abe\\nat the state banquet held in his honor during his official visit to the philippines\\n president duterte, thank you very much for your rousing welcome and heartwarming hospitality and for inviting us to this magnificent banquet tonight.since mr. president took office we had a total of three meetings including the one that we had today. and every time we see each other, we realize deepening friendship between the two and i am extremely delighted to establish such relationship with mr. president.the relationship between japan and the philippines is deep, warm and brotherly or family like relationship.president duterte built a monument with his own money when he was still serving as the mayor of davao city in honor of the friendship between japan and the philippines. the monument of no regret has a plaque inscribed with a japanese message of mr. president. in english, it says: and i would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt appreciation for president duterte’s heartfelt gesture of welcoming our japanese people as family members here in the philippines.back in october when president duterte visited japan, we had an unexpectedly long, long small group discussion way beyond the planned schedule. on that occasion, there was nothing and i did not serve alcoholic drinks but still, we had such an active dialogue and discussion. and i am confident that it was only possible because president duterte was mesmerized by the japanese cuisine washoku that i prepared for him.as part of my delegation, there are a total of 24 japanese business leaders representing prominent japanese corporations. everyone loves the philippines and i do hope that my visit this time will pave the way for further expansion of bilateral relationship not only in economic context but also in the areas of cultural and people to people exchanges.almost everyone in my delegation will visit davao city, mr. president’s home city, with me tomorrow and as you can imagine everyone is very much looking forward to the visit.with that, i’d like to now propose a toast for good health and happiness of mr. duterte and all of our guests and for the strengthened bond and friendship and cooperation between japan and the philippines.mabuhay! kanpai!'"
