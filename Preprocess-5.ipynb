       "'kindly sit down. thank you for your courtesy.health secretary francisco duque; climate change commission secretary emmanuel de guzman; the honorable members of the health from other asia pacific islands countries and other participants who are here with us today; his excellency zhao, ambassador of the people’s republic of china to the philippines; other distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemeni have a two page speech. i can finish this in about the most is two minutes. then what do we do? and that is why i proposed that i will just read the speech.i do not really give speeches. i want to dialogue sort of a with the audience.it speeches more than anybody of you here bores me to death. and so i am i tend to just deliver extemporaneous, i ignore but sometimes because maybe of the energy that this staff has also i kind of want to repay their toil. maybe this prepared was done this noontime hurriedly. so after my talk or would you rather that i will just read my speech and talk to you individually later.what seems to be the problem what ails the country of the philippines? just like any other country in the world it is vulnerable to what? changes. well, number one is because the carbon footprint they say is just too too many, too heavy a load for mother earth to carry.and so we had this climate change conference; and may i just read it so that you’d know that i’m here and i’m with you.ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to stand before you today and witness a new partnership that will be forged among regional players in the health sector.i acknowledge the joint efforts of the department of health, the department of foreign affairs, the climate change commission, and our private partners for hosting this cross country conference, which explores opportunities for networked approaches, common markets and sub regional procurement for goods, drugs and services.this is a very important event that will enable countries in the asia pacific to explore practical solutions to solve shared health problems and overcome common challenges in delivering essential medical services to our peoples.those of us located in the region, especially to the many island countries like ours, are indeed facing a very complex issue when it comes to healthcare. our geography has made establishing effective health systems that will be very difficult and costly. this vulnerability has become even more pronounced in times of natural disasters and calamities.therefore, if we are to genuinely secure the welfare of our peoples in the region, a comprehensive and networked approach to delivering healthcare employing the latest tools, innovations, techniques and solutions must be adopted. we must harmonize our policies and strategies so we can build responsive, effective and resilient health systems that will not only withstand disaster but also assist our neighbors in times of need.indeed, the distance between us may be vast but if we work together, we can bridge this gap and build a network of cooperation and collaboration. after all, to what end did we make our advancements in medicine, logistics, science and technology of what use would it be if we cannot use them to help our fellowmen and utilize the resources to enhance our shared humanity.to the delegates, rest assured that you have my full support as you engage with your counterparts and partners in our region and the rest of the world a much happier place to live in. and together, let us make it happen not just for ourselves, but for the generations to come.thank you and before i say my goodbye, we were late in enrolling ourselves in the commission, climate change.i had my doubts if could we ever compel the other nations especially the big and powerful ones to also obey the commonality of our determination.true enough, the united states withdrew from the i don’t know why. i really do not i have to fathom the reason or even the rationale or rationale of the withdrawal.is it because it cannot work hand in hand with other nations or is it because trump would like to do it alone? he’s my friend.and well, of course, i have been invited to the united states several times. but you know it’s not because of anybody or any place there. it has something to do with the schedule.if it could only be a regional flight where i can go fly in and fly out in the evening, that would be very easy. but the long haul of 13, 14 hours would kill me.i you know i used to be i used to fly when i was young. many years. i had about accumulated something like 670 hours of flying. but for the life of me, i cannot stand long flights anymore.even the recovery of a jet lag, it would take me about almost two to three days to just stretch it out before i can function as a person outside.and so we would like to see at least my country, that there’s really a something of a good faith on the part of everybody to do his share of the endeavor.there has to be an enterprise in the approach, business like, you honor your word. you do not exceed the limits that we have set for ourselves. and the one thing that i said we cannot really control are those countries who are highly industrialized and powerful enough to impose their own will. that’s the problem.when they say that, and so the philippines, historically, traditionally would always follow the western approach of a problem.then they begin counting the carbon footprints and they were the first to industrialize planet earth.they went to other countries, exploited the natural resources particularly in the middle east. lived off by the fat of the land and when they were there already on top suddenly they decide that it is good for humanity to adopt a climate change.so they are there already high up and for the starters, if you make it a proportional incremental increase in the output of carbons, well, you would say that they have a very great advantage because they started early.not even using their resources of its own but the goods of other countries. lived off with the fat of the land.so europe, it’s very easy to say, we understand that. it’s very simple actually. you do not go to the pacific, you just boil your water diyan in the kettle and you will see how it evaporates.but then who is strong enough to enforce? can we now call upon the other countries to say, but if you cannot do that, then do not impose on the other nations, the weaker ones, the percentages of carbon dioxide that one is allowed to swoop in the air. that was my misgiving in my delay to sign.but you know, i have a god. do not ever believe in those s***** but my god is the god that i we have different images of god by the way. as many people there are here, we have our own image in our mind of what god really looks like.me, i think that there’s a universal mind controlling the universe. he need not be named god, but at least there is somebody higher than us, controlling the universe or otherwise with the billions and trillions of planets and stars, we would start to collide with each other.now the fact that mother earth has reached 4.5 billion years old, it seems that my god watches over us. i don’t know about the god of the others. my god does not need money you know every there are two kinds of taxation here in this planet the taxation of government and the taxation of the church. and when they begin to ask, and i said, then i asked the same thing, in three tranches. that’s my basic objection actually. i thought that we are poor. so the philippines is not yet in parity with the others. we are pretty hard up and we’re trying to catch up.and i said, at this time let us be very clear on the limitations imposed on each other. i hope that our representatives in this commission would really work on something that is fair and fundamentally sound for everybody.me, i will just go by the developments and i’m sure that one is that we have to stop this thing about exploding missiles and throwing it to the sea and making a practice in the process, you kill so many marine lives there.and that would be about a fourth of the world’s consumption for five or 10 years. every time that you explode something that’s terrible in whatever oceans.so first is, before anything else, there has to be peace in the world. the south korea peninsula issue has to be resolved. then we stop egging iran to go to war. because then if that’s what will happen, even about a few hundreds of missiles, nuclear, then there’s no use of talking about climate change.the nuclear explosion, every time it’s being done, eats or erodes the dignity of earth altogether. and so it behooves upon the leaders of nations who are really there and who can make the change, they can do much. and we appreciate nations who approach the problem with sobriety, understanding and providing the cooler heads, so to speak.china is doing its job and the other countries. but really, i cannot be too generic in my selection because you know how it is. i’m sure everybody knows what are these things.and so before anything else, let us decide that we avoid war because that would be disaster. i think it would be the end of planet earth. and the residue of a nuclear explosions, even if it’s just a limited number of even 100 would greatly change the ecosystem of the world.it will result in hunger, the consequences of struggling life. and the problem is, if we do not do anything, if nobody listens to the plea of others just to take it, you know, with calm approach, we are the generation at this time that has to take our children.it is not yet their time. so it, i said, it behooves upon us to do everything to avoid all of these troubles. i said, for after all, if there’s a nuclear confrontation of what use would be the issue of climate change to us. and that is really a problem.but i hope that hand in hand with the toil of everybody, the burden of talking to this leader, just to keep the world going, and not to put it on the edge because it is not good for everybody.we are the parents of a generation that is really expecting of us and it is not yet their time. i don’t know what will happen if we do not do anything. and how can we characterize the life of the next generation would be.given the a one degree increase of the temperature would be disastrous. the resources of the oceans are getting to be constricted and very small. there’s not enough fish really to feed everybody and that’s the biggest resource of all are really our oceans and our seas.so it is kind of an awakening for everybody to address the problem of security and take care of climate change where you have people there who would be followed by their governments and governments who would honor the agreements entered into, especially if it comes from nations who cannot afford to be extravagant in all or whatever resource, food and everything, fossil fuel and even if it’s an electric cars, there’s the acid that you have to worry about.so there are things that that’s really would squarely would be a burden if at all to the highly developed nations. that we can only say and plead, please do it and remember everybody. not just your own interest, not your own hubris to solve the problems of it’s supposed to be one global village. what affects you, would affect china. what affects china would be a problem also, an issue in russia, and so on and on and on.first things first is just to decide to stand down, talk sense, remove the barriers. if it’s a wto thing, then let it run its course.we willingly agreed to be members of i mean you start to do something which is not really good and there’s a retaliation somewhere and you begin a competition that would end not only it would it can only end into one thing, this confrontation about the trade and everything.in the end at the end of the day, it’s going to be not a competition but a confrontation. so that we should bear in mind. i hope that the commission that will meet and once a year is not good. it is not enough. not even twice a year.climate change is not a typhoon that visits your country once or twice a year. climate change is a day to day problem and a day to day polishing, what ought to be the objectives of this country and for them.so first, as we have to make a head count; second, is begin to count what are you entitled to under this law and what would be the immediate consequence or result with the withdrawal of one and how would affect the others.can you now force or exact obedience from the other countries if the commission or the body itself that would govern try to control the carbon footprints in this planet is in disarray?so just it’s my two cents’ worth and that would be the advice that i will give to my representative since he’s going to somewhere.you know, i tell you what, to date, i have fired something like 16 three department secretaries, cabinet members, and 16 undersecretaries. why? so much travel.there’s a climate change in africa and they are there. there’s a climate change in new zealand and they are there en masse. then there’s a climate change in tokyo, they are there.every department sends somebody who does not even know the definition of a climate and how it changes. how is the process done to create a problem for the ecosystem and environment?so all of them. and when i saw the list of 11 travels, climate change conferences all over the world and it has nothing nothing good has come to my country except the expenses of going out and seeing the cities.to hell with climate change because whether you like it or not, the typhoon is coming from the philippines is the window of the pacific ocean. so that is how you b*** s*** with the money. you go.and i said to this day, i fired a lot. most of them were my friends who were with me when i was campaigning, and it pains me deeply to see them go.as i have had yesterday. it makes me sad but you know once and for all, we decide. we cannot be going to conventions every now and i would insist on one representative from the climate change commission, and i will not allow everybody to go out.you need only one mouth. we are not as rich as france, great britain where you can send a delegation. we can only afford to send one and maybe if it is to my liking, i might join her in the trip so that makes two of us, no more i think there’s a very articulate lady somewhere but she’s outside of the country. they say that you know, there’s a lot of issues against her but there’s the same i would want to verily the the whoever goes there will have to pass by my office and will only talk of what to say and how to make demands. you cannot ask. you cannot be forever requesting.so this time, you demand. we honor our agreement or we go separate ways. you spoil everything there. maybe we will spoil everything. by all means you want to end this planet? fine. let us do it. and do it in a hurry so that we will not suffer long.if everybody gets cancer, well, the timetable is after five years all of us will begin to suffer.and if you cannot bear it, then you go to switzerland. you sign a document there, you lie down, there’s a waiver, then you are given a button.if you like to go ahead, just press it. and you do not have to worry about climate change.thank you.'"

       "\"kindly sit down. thank you for your courtesy. health secretary francisco duque; climate change commission secretary emmanuel de guzman; the honorable members of the health from other asia pacific islands countries and other participants who are here with us today; his excellency zhao, ambassador of the people’s republic of china to the philippines; other distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen i have a two page speech. i can finish this in about the most is two minutes. then what do we do? and that is why i proposed that i will just read the speech. i do not really give speeches. i want to dialogue sort of a with the audience. it speeches more than anybody of you here bores me to death. and so i am i tend to just deliver extemporaneous, i ignore but sometimes because maybe of the energy that this staff has also i kind of want to repay their toil. maybe this prepared was done this noontime hurriedly. so after my talk or would you rather that i will just read my speech and talk to you individually later. what seems to be the problem what ails the country of the philippines? just like any other country in the world it is vulnerable to what? changes. well, number one is because the carbon footprint they say is just too too many, too heavy a load for mother earth to carry. and so we had this climate change conference; and may i just read it so that you’d know that i’m here and i’m with you. ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to stand before you today and witness a new partnership that will be forged among regional players in the health sector. i acknowledge the joint efforts of the department of health, the department of foreign affairs, the climate change commission, and our private partners for hosting this cross country conference, which explores opportunities for networked approaches, common markets and sub regional procurement for goods, drugs and services. this is a very important event that will enable countries in the asia pacific to explore practical solutions to solve shared health problems and overcome common challenges in delivering essential medical services to our peoples. those of us located in the region, especially to the many island countries like ours, are indeed facing a very complex issue when it comes to healthcare. our geography has made establishing effective health systems that will be very difficult and costly. this vulnerability has become even more pronounced in times of natural disasters and calamities. therefore, if we are to genuinely secure the welfare of our peoples in the region, a comprehensive and networked approach to delivering healthcare employing the latest tools, innovations, techniques and solutions must be adopted. we must harmonize our policies and strategies so we can build responsive, effective and resilient health systems that will not only withstand disaster but also assist our neighbors in times of need. indeed, the distance between us may be vast but if we work together, we can bridge this gap and build a network of cooperation and collaboration. after all, to what end did we make our advancements in medicine, logistics, science and technology of what use would it be if we cannot use them to help our fellowmen and utilize the resources to enhance our shared humanity. to the delegates, rest assured that you have my full support as you engage with your counterparts and partners in our region and the rest of the world a much happier place to live in. and together, let us make it happen not just for ourselves, but for the generations to come. thank you and before i say my goodbye, we were late in enrolling ourselves in the commission, climate change. i had my doubts if could we ever compel the other nations especially the big and powerful ones to also obey the commonality of our determination. true enough, the united states withdrew from the i don’t know why. i really do not i have to fathom the reason or even the rationale or rationale of the withdrawal. is it because it cannot work hand in hand with other nations or is it because trump would like to do it alone? he’s my friend. and well, of course, i have been invited to the united states several times. but you know it’s not because of anybody or any place there. it has something to do with the schedule. if it could only be a regional flight where i can go fly in and fly out in the evening, that would be very easy. but the long haul of 13, 14 hours would kill me. i you know i used to be i used to fly when i was young. many years. i had about accumulated something like 670 hours of flying. but for the life of me, i cannot stand long flights anymore. even the recovery of a jet lag, it would take me about almost two to three days to just stretch it out before i can function as a person outside. and so we would like to see at least my country, that there’s really a something of a good faith on the part of everybody to do his share of the endeavor. there has to be an enterprise in the approach, business like, you honor your word. you do not exceed the limits that we have set for ourselves. and the one thing that i said we cannot really control are those countries who are highly industrialized and powerful enough to impose their own will. that’s the problem. when they say that, and so the philippines, historically, traditionally would always follow the western approach of a problem. then they begin counting the carbon footprints and they were the first to industrialize planet earth. they went to other countries, exploited the natural resources particularly in the middle east. lived off by the fat of the land and when they were there already on top suddenly they decide that it is good for humanity to adopt a climate change. so they are there already high up and for the starters, if you make it a proportional incremental increase in the output of carbons, well, you would say that they have a very great advantage because they started early. not even using their resources of its own but the goods of other countries. lived off with the fat of the land. so europe, it’s very easy to say, we understand that. it’s very simple actually. you do not go to the pacific, you just boil your water diyan in the kettle and you will see how it evaporates. but then who is strong enough to enforce? can we now call upon the other countries to say, but if you cannot do that, then do not impose on the other nations, the weaker ones, the percentages of carbon dioxide that one is allowed to swoop in the air. that was my misgiving in my delay to sign. but you know, i have a god. do not ever believe in those s***** but my god is the god that i we have different images of god by the way. as many people there are here, we have our own image in our mind of what god really looks like. me, i think that there’s a universal mind controlling the universe. he need not be named god, but at least there is somebody higher than us, controlling the universe or otherwise with the billions and trillions of planets and stars, we would start to collide with each other. now the fact that mother earth has reached 4.5 billion years old, it seems that my god watches over us. i don’t know about the god of the others. my god does not need money you know every there are two kinds of taxation here in this planet the taxation of government and the taxation of the church. and when they begin to ask, and i said, then i asked the same thing, in three tranches. that’s my basic objection actually. i thought that we are poor. so the philippines is not yet in parity with the others. we are pretty hard up and we’re trying to catch up. and i said, at this time let us be very clear on the limitations imposed on each other. i hope that our representatives in this commission would really work on something that is fair and fundamentally sound for everybody. me, i will just go by the developments and i’m sure that one is that we have to stop this thing about exploding missiles and throwing it to the sea and making a practice in the process, you kill so many marine lives there. and that would be about a fourth of the world’s consumption for five or 10 years. every time that you explode something that’s terrible in whatever oceans. so first is, before anything else, there has to be peace in the world. the south korea peninsula issue has to be resolved. then we stop egging iran to go to war. because then if that’s what will happen, even about a few hundreds of missiles, nuclear, then there’s no use of talking about climate change. the nuclear explosion, every time it’s being done, eats or erodes the dignity of earth altogether. and so it behooves upon the leaders of nations who are really there and who can make the change, they can do much. and we appreciate nations who approach the problem with sobriety, understanding and providing the cooler heads, so to speak. china is doing its job and the other countries. but really, i cannot be too generic in my selection because you know how it is. i’m sure everybody knows what are these things. and so before anything else, let us decide that we avoid war because that would be disaster. i think it would be the end of planet earth. and the residue of a nuclear explosions, even if it’s just a limited number of even 100 would greatly change the ecosystem of the world. it will result in hunger, the consequences of struggling life. and the problem is, if we do not do anything, if nobody listens to the plea of others just to take it, you know, with calm approach, we are the generation at this time that has to take our children. it is not yet their time. so it, i said, it behooves upon us to do everything to avoid all of these troubles. i said, for after all, if there’s a nuclear confrontation of what use would be the issue of climate change to us. and that is really a problem. but i hope that hand in hand with the toil of everybody, the burden of talking to this leader, just to keep the world going, and not to put it on the edge because it is not good for everybody. we are the parents of a generation that is really expecting of us and it is not yet their time. i don’t know what will happen if we do not do anything. and how can we characterize the life of the next generation would be. given the a one degree increase of the temperature would be disastrous. the resources of the oceans are getting to be constricted and very small. there’s not enough fish really to feed everybody and that’s the biggest resource of all are really our oceans and our seas. so it is kind of an awakening for everybody to address the problem of security and take care of climate change where you have people there who would be followed by their governments and governments who would honor the agreements entered into, especially if it comes from nations who cannot afford to be extravagant in all or whatever resource, food and everything, fossil fuel and even if it’s an electric cars, there’s the acid that you have to worry about. so there are things that that’s really would squarely would be a burden if at all to the highly developed

barriers. if it's a wto thing, then let it run its course. we willingly agreed to be members of i mean you start to do something which is not really good and there's a retaliation somewhere and you

throwing it to the sea and making a practice in the process, you kill so many marine lives there.and that would be about a fourth of the world’s consumption for five or 10 years. every time that you explode something that’s terrible in whatever oceans.so first is, before anything else, there has to be peace in the world. the south korea peninsula issue has to be resolved. then we stop egging iran to go to war. because then if that’s what will happen, even about a few hundreds of missiles, nuclear, then there’s no use of talking about climate change.the nuclear explosion, every time it’s being done, eats or erodes the dignity of earth altogether. and so it behooves upon the leaders of nations who are really there and who can make the change, they can do much. and we appreciate nations who approach the problem with sobriety, understanding and providing the cooler heads, so to speak.china is doing its job and the other countries. but really, i cannot be too generic in my selection because you know how it is. i’m sure everybody knows what are these things.and so before anything else, let us decide that we avoid war because that would be disaster. i think it would be the end of planet earth. and the residue of a nuclear explosions, even if it’s just a limited number of even 100 would greatly change the ecosystem of the world.it will result in hunger, the consequences of struggling life. and the problem is, if we do not do anything, if nobody listens to the plea of others just to take it, you know, with calm approach, we are the generation at this time that has to take our children.it is not yet their time. so it, i said, it behooves upon us to do everything to avoid all of these troubles. i said, for after all, if there’s a nuclear confrontation of what use would be the issue of climate change to us. and that is really a problem.but i hope that hand in hand with the toil of everybody, the burden of talking to this leader, just to keep the world going, and not to put it on the edge because it is not good for everybody.we are the parents of a generation that is really expecting of us and it is not yet their time. i don’t know what will happen if we do not do anything. and how can we characterize the life of the next generation would be.given the a one degree increase of the temperature would be disastrous. the resources of the oceans are getting to be constricted and very small. there’s not enough fish really to feed everybody and that’s the biggest resource of all are really our oceans and our seas.so it is kind of an awakening for everybody to address the problem of security and take care of climate change where you have people there who would be followed by their governments and governments who would honor the agreements entered into, especially if it comes from nations who cannot afford to be extravagant in all or whatever resource, food and everything, fossil fuel and even if it’s an electric cars, there’s the acid that you have to worry about.so there are things that that’s really would squarely would be a burden if at all to the highly developed nations. that we can only say and plead, please do it and remember everybody. not just your own interest, not your own hubris to solve the problems of it’s supposed to be one global village. what affects you, would affect china. what affects china would be a problem also, an issue in russia, and so on and on and on.first things first is just to decide to stand down, talk sense, remove the barriers. if it’s a wto thing, then let it run its course.we willingly agreed to be members of i mean you start to do something which is not really good and there’s a retaliation somewhere and you begin a competition that would end not only it would it can only end into one thing, this confrontation about the trade and everything.in the end at the end of the day, it’s going to be not a competition but a confrontation. so that we should bear in mind. i hope that the commission that will meet and once a year is not good. it is not enough. not even twice a year.climate change is not a typhoon that visits your country once or twice a year. climate change is a day to day problem and a day to day polishing, what ought to be the objectives of this country and for them.so first, as we have to make a head count; second, is begin to count what are you entitled to under this law and what would be the immediate consequence or result with the withdrawal of one and how would affect the others.can you now force or exact obedience from the other countries if the commission or the body itself that would govern try to control the carbon footprints in this planet is in disarray?so just it’s my two cents’ worth and that would be the advice that i will give to my representative since he’s going to somewhere.you know, i tell you what, to date, i have fired something like 16 three department secretaries, cabinet members, and 16 undersecretaries. why? so much travel.there’s a climate change in africa and they are there. there’s a climate change in new zealand and they are there en masse. then there’s a climate change in tokyo, they are there.every department sends somebody who does not even know the definition of a climate and how it changes. how is the process done to create a problem for the ecosystem and environment?so all of them. and when i saw the list of 11 travels, climate change conferences all over the world and it has nothing nothing good has come to my country except the expenses of going out and seeing the cities.to hell with climate change because whether you like it or not, the typhoon is coming from the philippines is the window of the pacific ocean. so that is how you b*** s*** with the money. you go.and i said to this day, i fired a lot. most of them were my friends who were with me when i was campaigning, and it pains me deeply to see them go.as i have had yesterday. it makes me sad but you know once and for all, we decide. we cannot be going to conventions every now and i would insist on one representative from the climate change commission, and i will not allow everybody to go out.you need only one mouth. we are not as rich as france, great britain where you can send a delegation. we can only afford to send one and maybe if it is to my liking, i might join her in the trip so that makes two of us, no more i think there’s a very articulate lady somewhere but she’s outside of the country. they say that you know, there’s a lot of issues against her but there’s the same i would want to verily the the whoever goes there will have to pass by my office and will only talk of what to say and how to make demands. you cannot ask. you cannot be forever requesting.so this time, you demand. we honor our agreement or we go separate ways. you spoil everything there. maybe we will spoil everything. by all means you want to end this planet? fine. let us do it. and do it in a hurry so that we will not suffer long.if everybody gets cancer, well, the timetable is after five years all of us will begin to suffer.and if you cannot bear it, then you go to switzerland. you sign a document there, you lie down, there’s a waiver, then you are given a button.if you like to go ahead, just press it. and you do not have to worry about climate change.thank you.'"

       "'daghang salamat. kindly sit down. thank you for your courtesy.i have a prepared speech. it’s a one page but let me just bring you to the tunnel of vignettes in life.in 2013, sa after dark, diyan ho ako nag iistambay before going home to take my coffee there, kaharap ko for several occasions si bebot, speaker. at sinabi niya sa akin, di ako naman natawa. sabi ko, sabi niya, so i don’t know in what dimension of time was he in. but ang second batch talaga, all generals that was led by faeldon, mga 2013, and i was surprised because they were urging me to run and i said, yung sabi ko, i do not have the money, i do not have the political base. it’s just a small city and maybe, if i limit myself to that area, i might make it every election.but for me to dream of something big, sabi ko, gusto ko lang magkwento sa inyo because this is how it developed to where i am hindi nga ako sanay na ganito.then came solicitor general natin, si calida. he was the one who said, at sinabi ko sa kanya, because he went to the place just to talk to me but when he sat down in front of me, which somebody si pulis, i forgot his name. is he here?sabi ko na, sabi niya, so sabi ko, tapos si bebot bello, sabi niya, so sabi, well, and so on and so forth. nakita ko sila roy and cimatu, he used to be assigned here, diyan sa kampo, tapos si greg, always asking me also if i’m running.i really do not know what i seem to be at a loss to explain why i became president.ang nagsuporta lang sa akin, si abet garcia ng bataan, governor; si governor ng agusan del norte, pati si imee. yun lang tatlo. wala na akong ni wala akong barangay captain, ni wala lahat.but because i don’t know why. si bebot talaga kept on pushing and he said, sabi ko, sabi ko, sabi ko, sabi ko, so si bot, sila mike, tapos suddenly, the election was just parang if almost just a flash, naging presidente na ako.ang during the campaign, ang sinabi ko lang, that’s why i was very conscious na ako ang nauna nakatapos. even during the presidential debates, i was ahead because i said, this is just my promise to you: graft and corruption and i will stop drugs and improve the countryside para yung, the weakest link really is agriculture but if we can have manufacturing right here or maybe right just within the periphery of where you are planting, whatever it is, it would produce more, less freight and less everything and spur the movement of goods and services.and lastly, sabi ko, i have to talk to the communist party of the philippines, the bangsamoro, and everybody fighting the government.so, dito sa muslim insurgency, i am really awaiting for the product of congress, but i have my own, yung executive order no. 10.ayaw ko na munang bitawan kasi out of respect sa congress. but if you want some resource persons, anyway we start with justice puno, if you want to hear them, i’d be glad to transmit the message.ang sasabihin ko lang sa inyo ito, and i’ve been warning everybody that something went wrong during the imperialist days. we were conquered, we were subdued, subjugated, and just being under a sovereign power.in that event, it has caused a lot of injustices, most of them in mindanao, committed against the moro people.so sinabi ko na ito ang sasabihin ko uli without really batting an eyelash: if we can not concede something that would require a correction of a wrong, na hindi na maaring magawa yan. we were not the ones who did it, the imperialists did it.we don’t have to mention the names now because it’s not time for recriminations.but kailangan natin mabigyan sila because if not, i am afraid there will be war. yan ang dapat intindihin ng lalo na yung hindi taga davao. it is that dangerous.so i am happy that instead of the celebrant who is busy eating, making himself strong for the night, kasi depende nga sa kalaban, talagang matatag ang kalaban eh. maganda pa.ito man rin ang advice niya. pabalik balik yan siya, i said, i said, sabi niya, okay, i’ll run. alam niyo naman ang buhay ko. my life is an open secret. quite distinct.so it started. ngayon, presidente na ako. i will insist on corruption. it has to stop.i will fight the drug problem to the last day of my term. it will not stop.i was wrong when i said that i could stop it but at that time, i was uttering the words when i was only mayor of davao city.but i was a bit successful in cleaning the city, a certain degree. but really, to make it drug free is something which is really impossible.it was not until after i became president, i said, that i had access to all information about drugs and its dimension in the entire country.so doon ko nalaman na kalaban ko na pati pulis, kalaban ko na yung customs, kalaban ko na lahat and i was up against a formidable group of alam mo, you cannot go into a drug business without an organization.so pagka may organization talaga from the one who cooks, to the one who distributes, to the one yung mga basurero, yung sa labas, peddling drugs.and most of the time, they are using itong mga minors and sad to say, actually, the law it was not pangilinan but it was his law that provided for this kind of environment now.pati yung mga pulis, kayo, alam ninyo, mga mayor. you cannot arrest, even detain for a moment, a minor.and you are not even allowed even to lecture on him or to him, even a minute of what accountability means to society.wala eh. kaya paghuli, pagsabi minor eh, and that is why, yun pati mga bata ginagamit.and worse, they say, as i said, you cannot operate a drug syndicate without an organization.so the law says that the one who cooks, the one who distributes, and the one who peddles the drugs are equally equally guilty.the act of one is the act of all because it is a conspiracy. that is the law.and my oath of office says that i have to enforce the law against everybody who violates the law.so kung ikaw, mahirap ka sa buhay, i cannot do anything and say, that would be a selective justice.and i cannot say that this law is only for the rich but not for the poor.but remember, shabu is a merchandize for the poor. yung nandiyan sa forbes park, nandiyan sa dasmariñas, they do not do it with shabu. they do it with cocaine and heroin.the most popular ngayon, pumapasok at malakas, ang cocaine, which is a derivative of poppy. at least, it is organic.itong shabu is a mixture of deadly chemicals and it shrinks the brain of a person.kaya ako galit dito sa mga human rights pati yung sa labas, one left lady, taga left, managed herself to become a rapporteur.so i was investigated by a rapporteur two years ago and i said when he started to ask a question, kaya sabi ko kaya bastos talaga, eh nakaka insulto eh. at ibigay ko yang talagang sabi ko nga sa interview kanina, and i realized that being president, hindi ka na makasabi ng p***** i**, hindi ka na maka too late to change eh. it’s in the persona embedded deeply in the psychic mind. wala na akong magawa niyan.so kung magsalita ako, parang mayor. and that is why everybody who addresses me as president would give a would come a reply something like, kaya ugali ko talaga, pang mayor lang. nung sinabi nila na hindi ako statesman, hindi naman ako nag aral pang statesman.ang sabi, eh talagang bastos ang bunganga ko, lalo na pag asarin mo ako.so but the problem pero ang gusto ko lang sabihin sa inyo, kami, i have a very supportive congress senate president and the speaker, they are supportive of me and they are correct. given or not given dahil magkasama tayo. kasi corruption talaga nandiyan and i’m starting it with those guys who have been wasting money, going in and out of the country as if they owned the money and for nothing.they go out every convocation, convention, powwow, seminar, labas ng labas. and for those who have traveled more than 12, you have to go.hindi na ako bilib diyan sa most of the time nag ibang bansa. let’s say the cabinet members, yung mga foreign affairs, yung only official military, they go to schooling.go, walang problema man. limang buwan? o sige. but yung mag attend ng p** karamihan ng dumaan sa akin, almost every conference regarding climate change, kung sino sino ang kuwan.everybody wants to attend and everybody was really attending to those present. climate change, climate change. climate change?simula sila nag naimbento nila yang climate change, mas dumami ang bagyo ng p***** i**** dumating dito sa pilipinas.kakalabas lang ng isa, ito na yung sa p***, sumusundot.unless the big ones realize that they have to look after the small one. ganun na eh.when they wanted control of the climate, nasa taas na sila eh.they were imperialists, they were living the fat of the land, oil of the arab to build this kind of ngayon, tayo na nandito, they’re all we’re all given us a proportionate kalokohan yan. tama si trump and there’s no way whether or not they are really telling the truth.so sabi ko, pag isipan natin uli and most of you are maybe connected to this issue.just think about the banning of the open pit. talagang nasisira ang bayan natin. wala akong wala akong ibang mautos kay general cimatu except that please, kindly take care of the environment for the next generation. it has to it has to stop, at i chose general cimatu, who used to be the diyan sa .we used to go there, nagmo motor, naki tagal ko nang kilala kasi si roy and bato, and si greg. we are friends, many, many years ago.when they were just they were not actually hiding. they were here in davao, nagmo motor lang kami araw araw, gabi gabi, umiikot kami ng ano. he was wanted for the longest time, but he was enjoying life as if it had no tomorrow.so yan ang ano ko dito sa mining because alam ko na pinakamarami dito. the prosperity of tagum has its roots sa mining.so whatever is left there, well, you cannot forever produce gold, although its unstoppable, it rises to the surface from the bowels of the earth. pero medyo depleted na ata, like any other human, you have to slow down.pero yan lang ang akin. i’m sorry to say that i’m not ready to talk to the communists. i have talked several times with them and with the representatives. it sums just like a coalition government kaya hinintuan ko na.stop. i cannot give you what i do not own and sovereignty of the people, sabi ng ating constitution, can only be exercised by people who are elected.you cannot be just an appointed one or an arrangement whereby we join tapos you share with the powers of government. that ain’t hindi talaga pwede.sabi ko, at this early, i cannot do anything, mahirap eh. mahirap. that cannot be done. you go mainstream, let go of your guns and i will even join you in a party, but armed struggle? mahirap yan.we do not kill each other just because we want to be in government, mahirap yan.so yan lang ang ano ko, bebot naman, you are ito nireserba ko na lang because these are all praises.but today, i would like god thank god to to having you as a friend and a very maski saan saan ka nung kampanya, buong pilipinas, not until after he decided also to run na nawala sila but most of the time, they were with me in the campaign.so bebot bello, iniwan nga si binay. kaya ang iyak ni binay ngayon, para sa iyo yun eh, brod rin sila eh ni pero when he was sabi niya, iwanan niya.so most of you are my supporters, maybe, and that explains the reason why na medyo malaki yung boto ko. but you were there when i needed you.si bato, i think he’s headed for and finally, we would have a solution sa ating mga presohan.he will take over bucor but his jurisdiction is also far and wide, including the penal colonies of the government.general año used to be the chief of staff, its now jagger. i am eyeing jagger, yung chief of staff ngayon.ito si jagger, matindi to, mas matindi kay general año, hindi yan tumatawa, naka ang mukha naka ano, hindi kagaya kay roy na smiling, espesyalista ito sa mga waray na babae. waray ka lipay. i’m inclined to appoint año as i want the marina chief out, i want him out. travel tapos 20 times? 18 times? ubos ang pera ng tao diyan. anak ng kaya i have this order, one, nobody travels, well, i do not include the congress pati yung judiciary. yung sa executive department, under my control.i i just signed an executive order banning travel. you let me know first and i will read, i need to know what you are going for after the after the yung iba naman nage enroll lang doon tapos hindi naman nag a attend.so as of now, i’ve mahirap ang travel ngayon, down, pati local officials, down.local government will enforce it, you have to be sure to give me well ahead in time your itinerary and give me a synopsis or just a short memo of what you intend to do and what is it all about. yan lang ang ano ko, it’s part of the campaign against corruption. not only done with malice but those who just want to spend money of government for nothing. wag ho kayong magalit sa akin because these are the promises that i i said, drugs, and thousands sabi nila namatay, well, sabi ko, i said, you cannot operate without an organization, especially when it comes to distribution and the selling of drugs.and i really do not care if you are the the lost poor soul na mahirap o pinaka mayaman, i do not even care if you are the mayor.yung mga mayors na pati yung mga pulis pinapatay, pulis nila pinapatay if they go against them, you know, you have to do something about it.using the platform of the mayorship for drug distribution, you’re signing your death warrant there, totoo lang. yung iba siguro can take it but i cannot, hindi ko kayang sikmurain yan, na pati na mga tao sa gobyerno papatayin mo, lalo na pulis mo? then you are asking, really, for something that is agony and yun lang po. babasahin ko lang itong ginawa ng malacañan, which is really a reflection of what you are.life is great at any age and turning 60 is only the beginning of many greater things.to our celebrant, speaker pantaleon alvarez, may this time in your life be the start of new experiences as you look forward to another year of prosperity and opportunities coming your way.your thoughtful leadership, great vision, you can fathom a face from afar, especially if it is the image of a beautiful woman. wala yan diyan, buang, dito akin lang yan. your thoughtful leadership, great vision, and sincerity as a lawmaker and public servant have had a positive impact on the changes we are doing for our nation.by the way, magkasama kami ni bebot sa congress, 11th congress during the time of villar. ang speaker namin si congressman belmonte was our kasama namin sa congress, a very valued worker of government.we value your hard work and commitment to your profession and i’m truly grateful to have you as a friend and ally, whom i can count on in achieving our shared vision of uplifting the lives of filipinos.wish you the best in your future endeavors. here is another fulfilling year of good health, happiness and success.mr. speaker, i hope that you are married for the last time. happy birthday and mabuhay ka. – comments'"

       "'good afternoon to everybody. mr. prime minister. i am very honored to visit the state of israel. it was an invitation extended.with that, i hope that this country will continue with its friendly and warm relationship. i’d like to thank the state of israel for the so many assistance given us. but i’d be good to mention it. but in terms of the marawi siege, we got help from your country. thank you for that. and thank you for hosting almost 28,000 filipinos. they have been very happy working here, taking care of the aging population of yours, citizens. and i have heard that they have been treated as human beings unlike in other places of which i am not at liberty to mention now. but the way that they have been received here was shown last night by their jubilation. and of course everytime i mentioned about the kindness and benevolence of israel, you could here a thunderclap and i am sure that they were came from the heart. mr. prime minister, i can only thank you so much especially the critical help that you have extended my country in time when we needed it most. the recent trouble in my the philippines, the extent of the help that you extended were very critical in winning the war. i could have dragged on were it not for the very substantial and crucial equipments, which i am not also at liberty to say now. but it was a help to preserve the republic of the philippines and i thank you for that. i thank the state of israel and the people. and i hope that these ties of us will continue over the years. and i think i have my daughter here who is a zimmerman. actually she is a descendant of the jews, who went to the philippines and who settled down there many, many years ago during the time of the holocaust. we received the israelis there and their families and i am sure that many of them have spread all throughout the country. and one of them is the family of my daughter. it’s not the daughter but the mother was a homegrown zimmerman in our place. thank you and may we continue to be blessed with a strong relationship. i do not think that there will ever be a time when there is an irritation even between our two countries. we share the same passion for peace. we share the same passion for human beings but we also share the same passion of not allowing our country to be destroyed by those who have the corrupt ideology who knows nothing but to kill and destroy. in this sense, israel can expect any help that the philippines can extend to your country. thank you very much.'"

    "txt = 'Kindly sit down. Thank you. You know, I was told that I cannot entertain media questions because we are running late. But because you are here beautiful ladies, we can have until four o’clock this afternoon. Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea; Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano; members of the Secre --- Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra and the other members of the Cabinet; Senator Richard Gordon; honorable members of the House of Representatives; Manila International Airport Authority General Manager Eddie Monreal; Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte; officials of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police; our local and elected government officials who are here with us this afternoon; fellow workers of government; mga kababayan. I leave today for landmark visits that underscore our vision for our country – a responsible member of the world community – a Philippines that is a friend to all, an enemy to no one. Upon [the] invitation of the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, I shall undertake an Official Visit to Israel from September 2 to 5. I don’t know if it is mentioned in the letter. We have about 28,000 Filipinos in Israel and there are 48,000 Filipinos in Jordan. And you know, without mentioning anything, there’s a volatile situation there and we have to be sure that our citizens are fully protected. My schedule will be full. I shall seek to reaffirm the ties between our peoples made more significant by a meaningful shared history. At the same time, I shall seek to have a robust relationship that looks forward to broader cooperation on a broad range of mutually important areas – defense and security, law enforcement, economic development, trade [and] investments and labor. Upon the invitation of His Majesty King Abdullah II, I shall likewise undertake an Official Visit to the Kingdom of Jordan from September 5 to 8. The agenda is promising, as I seek to renew relations with a country and people which have the common aspirations. Certainly, I look forward to discussing ways [of] advancing cooperation in the key areas of improving defense and security, sustaining growth, addressing transnational crime, intensifying trade and investments and enhancing labor cooperation. I shall seek to fully maximize economic cooperation and realize trade potential with both Israel and Jordan. A business delegation from different sectors of the Philippine economy will be there in order to explore the diverse trade and investment opportunities that makes Jordan and Israel more tempting to offer. Of course, we will invite their business leaders to look at our own rich market potential. With more than two million Filipinos [working] in that region, I intend to emphasize the great importance that the Philippines attaches to maintaining peace and stability in the region. In my meeting with the Filipino communities, I shall renew my pledge to do my utmost to bring the change we desire in our country, in ourselves as a people. I will ask them to continue to be our partners for growth, progress and change. In these Official Visits, I shall continue to be guided by my mandate to uphold and protect the national interests of the Philippines. The Philippines shares with all countries the desire for a stable and secure world. In our efforts to strengthen the bonds of friendship and amity with our partners around the world, we shall be guided by our Constitution and laws as well as our international commitments in support of efforts and initiatives, including the two-state solution, towards the attainment of just and lasting peace. Salamat po. I can maybe --- you do not waste my time. I do not want to disappoint your time so I can have one or two. Secretary if…'"
